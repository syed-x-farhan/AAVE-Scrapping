LTF Analysis:

The $AAVE chart is looking quite interesting at the moment. $AAVE has just completed its CD leg and appears primed for a reversal. On the lower timeframe, $AAVE has been trading within a descending channel and is currently testing the channel's upper boundary.

If $AAVE successfully flips the trendline resistance into support, a long position can be considered, with the first target set around the $195 horizontal resistance level. On the other hand, if $AAVE faces rejection here, a safer long entry could be from the horizontal support level, where the CD leg would fully complete. Keep monitoring $AAVE for potential long opportunities.

356252128,2025-03-15 16:25:45,1742055945196.0,"🚨 Trump-Backed Crypto Project WLFI Closes Token Sale After Raising $590 Million.
The World Liberty Financial Initiative (WLFI), a notable cryptocurrency project backed by US President Donald Trump, has successfully concluded its token sale, raising an impressive $590 million. This achievement puts WLFI among the top 10 largest token raises in history.
WLFI tokens were exclusively sold to accredited investors, meaning they cannot be freely traded or transferred to the public. As of now, there is no announced timeline for when WLFI tokens might be listed on exchanges. Launched in September 2024, the project aims to push decentralized finance (DeFi) forward while supporting US dollar-pegged stablecoins to bolster the USD's global dominance. At its core, WLFI features a DeFi lending platform.
The governance token, WLFI, opened for public sale on October 15, initially aiming to raise $300 million by selling 20 billion tokens at $0.015 each. However, demand was weaker than expected, leading to a revised fundraising goal of $30 million after just 766 million tokens sold, which brought in $11 million.
Interest in WLFI surged after the success of Trump-related meme coins like Official Trump (TRUMP) and Official Melania (MELANIA). By January 20, the initial sale wrapped up with 20% of the total supply sold. In response to increased demand, WLFI introduced an additional 5 billion tokens priced at $0.05 each, which quickly neared sellout by March 13.
WLFI token holders will receive governance rights over the WLF Protocol, although tokens will remain non-transferable for the first year after launch. Notable investor Justin Sun, founder of Tron, made headlines by buying $30 million worth of WLFI tokens in late November, securing his position as the top investor.
Despite the fundraising success, WLFI's portfolio of 9 crypto assets is currently battling a loss of $124 million. Major losses arise from Wrapped Bitcoin ($wBTC), Aave ($AAVE), and Tron ($TRX) amid a turbulent market week. Interestingly, WLFI's holdings are heavily invested in Ethereum ($ETH), accounting for 65% of its portfolio. The company acquired ETH at roughly $3,240 a token, but with prices dropping to around $1,900, this has significantly impacted overall portfolio losses.

356235707,2025-03-15 04:04:45,1742011485069.0,"Earn 200% APR on USDC Using Hedera’s DeFi Ecosystem : A Thread
Earning high yield on USDC is tough.
Most DeFi platforms barely offer 5% APY, and gas fees eat into profits.
On Hedera, things are different—Bonzo Finance & SaucerSwap offer up to 200% APR on USDC.
Here’s how to earn 👇
2/ Why
@hedera
? The Best Chain for USDC Yield
Hedera isn’t just another L1—it’s built for high-speed, low-cost DeFi:
✅ 10,000+ TPS → Instant transactions
✅ Near-zero fees → $0.0001 per tx
✅ No front-running or MEV
✅ USDC on Hedera is Binance-supported
3/ Method 1: Bonzo Finance (17-20% APY Lending USDC)
@bonzo_finance
is Hedera’s top lending protocol—think Aave, but with better rates & no gas fees.
📌 Supply USDC → Earn ~17% APY
📌 Interest auto-compounds
📌 No impermanent loss
Here’s how to start 👇
Bonzo Finance Highlighted The USDC strategy on their feed
4/a Step-by-Step: Earning USDC Yield on Bonzo
1️⃣ Set up a Hedera wallet (HashPack)
2️⃣ Transfer USDC from Binance → HashPack
3️⃣ Go to Bonzo Finance & connect wallet
4️⃣ Deposit USDC → Start earning passive income
Simple, zero risk of impermanent loss, and stable returns.
4/b Why Bonzo?
✅ Low-risk stablecoin yield
✅ No market volatility exposure
✅ Auto-compounded interest for higher returns
If you prefer safe, predictable APY, this is the best DeFi option on Hedera.
But what if you want higher yields? That’s where SaucerSwap comes in 👇
5/ Method 2: SaucerSwap (Up to 200% APR in Liquidity Pools)
@SaucerSwapLabs
is Hedera’s largest DEX, offering high-yield LP staking.
📌 USDC/HBAR LP = ~200% APR
📌 Earn swap fees + staking rewards
📌 No gas fees = higher net returns
Here’s how to start 👇
Saucerswap Also offers Great opportunities in USDC Yield
6/a Step-by-Step: Earning 200% APR on SaucerSwap
1️⃣ Set up HashPack Wallet
2️⃣ Transfer USDC & HBAR from Binance
3️⃣ Go to SaucerSwap & connect wallet
4️⃣ Deposit equal USDC/HBAR into LP
5️⃣ Stake LP tokens → Earn rewards
That’s it! You’re now earning yield in real-time.
6/b Why SaucerSwap?
✅ No gas fees → No earnings lost to high tx costs
✅ 200% APR beats most DeFi pools
✅ Extra HBAR incentives boost rewards
Higher risk than Bonzo (impermanent loss exists), but insane upside for DeFi farmers.
7/ Bonzo vs. SaucerSwap
⚡ Bonzo (17-20%) → Safe, predictable APY (no IL risk)
⚡ SaucerSwap (200%) → High-yield LP farming (but IL exists)
Risk tolerance matters. Want safe passive income? → Bonzo.
Want max yield? → SaucerSwap.
8/ Why This Yield Opportunity is Unique
💰 Stable APY on USDC is rare—Hedera’s low fees make it possible.
🚀 No need to farm & dump tokens—You’re earning in USDC, not volatile alts.
🔒 More security, less risk—Both platforms are backed by top Hedera teams.
9/ Should You Move USDC to Hedera?
Ethereum & Solana DeFi yields are Good but Hedera’s 17-200% APR on USDC is one of the best stablecoin plays right now.
With Binance supporting USDC on Hedera, access is easier than ever.
🔥 That’s your step-by-step guide to earning yield on Hedera!

On-Chain:
- Volume buy from 3 labels has appeared continuously in the past 7 days.
- 2/3 mentioned wallets continue to accumulate.
- $AAVE is currently in the SDT Accumulation Zone.

Spot:
- CVD is increasing while the price is decreasing. (Coinalyze)
=> It can be assumed that the dip-buying force is very strong but only actively buys when the price is low.

Future:
- The liquidity zone is mostly concentrated at $202 and further at $402. (CoinGlass)
- OI has not yet shown signs of increasing again.
- Funding Rate is negative.

Technical Analysis:
- The price is currently reacting to the nearest support zone at $159 - $169.
- The nearest resistance: $190 - $200, which is also a zone with a significant amount of liquidity concentration.
- If the price holds the $159 - $169 zone, it is likely to move toward $190 - $200 afterward.
- If the price breaks through the $159 - $169 zone, it is likely to drop further to the $125 - $135 support zone.",2025-03-15 22:47:46

Investors took notice, with $AAVE surging 21% in just 24 hours, far outpacing the broader market's modest 3.5% increase. If this proposal passes, it could be like discovering an unexpected treat at a party that you thought was winding down.

TL;DR
- The “Aavenomics update” aims to boost $AAVE token value and user rewards, featuring increased profit sharing and a $1 million weekly buyback program.
- Aave plans to introduce a self-protection system called “Umbrella” to shield users from market downturns, setting a new standard in user protection.

The “Aavenomics update” is being hailed as a game-changer for Aave. Marc “Billy” Zeller expressed his excitement on Twitter, inviting community feedback. After five years of hard work, they’re ready to redefine user interactions on their platform.

One standout feature is the Anti-GHO token, which offers unique options: burn it to erase GHO debt or convert it into staked GHO (StkGHO) for extra rewards. It’s like having a secret menu item that could save you some cash.

With plans for a $1 million weekly buyback of $AAVE tokens, Aave is not just stabilizing prices but rewarding loyal users. Plus, the “Umbrella” system promises to protect users from bad debts, making Aave a beacon of safety in the crypto world.

#crypto
project has a liquidity pool. Whether a project uses one depends on its goals, use case, and ecosystem design.
Let’s break it down so you can understand why some projects rely on them and others don’t.
#VolumintThread
#DeFi
💡What is a Liquidity Pool?
A liquidity pool is a smart contract-based reserve of funds (usually two tokens) that allows users to trade without relying on traditional order books. Common in DEXs like Uniswap or PancakeSwap.
#LiquidityPools
#DEX
Projects That Typically Use Liquidity Pools:
✅ Most
#DeFi
projects rely on pools to function. Think Uniswap for swaps, Aave for loans, etc.
✅ New tokens often create pools to ensure their tokens are tradable.
✅
#Stablecoins
or asset-backed tokens use pools to stabilize prices.
Why
#LiquidityPools
Matter:
✔️ Ensure liquidity for traders (less slippage).
✔️ Incentivize participation via rewards (fees, yield farming).
✔️ Help new tokens gain traction.
But poorly managed pools can lead to issues like impermanent loss or low liquidity.⚠️
#Volumint
Not all crypto projects need liquidity pools. Their necessity depends on whether the project is decentralized, how users interact with its tokens, and its overall goals.

Multiply your yield streams with USDC lending + $weETH/ $ezETH/ $rsETH staking.
Breakdown below.
1/11
Your returns = USDC lending + 3 different restaking yields - ETH borrowing costs
How?
• Deposit USDC, earn ~3.81% Aave lending interest
• Borrow ETH at only ~2.27% against your USDC
• Convert borrowed ETH to weETH, ezETH, and rsETH → earn 3x restaking yields
2/11
Why?
Validators earn additional yield by securing multiple networks with the same ETH.
By using three different restaking tokens (from
@ether_fi
@RenzoProtocol
@KelpDAO
), this strategy captures yields from 3 Ethereum restaking ecosystems.
3/11
So?
Triple the exposure = optimized risk-reward.
• Diversified exposure across multiple restaking protocols
• Lower risk from protocol-specific failures
• Higher yield potential from varied strategies
• More resilience against token depegging
4/11
The math works in your favor:
1. USDC earns ~3.81% on Aave
2. ETH borrowing costs only ~2.27%
3. weETH, ezETH & rsETH continuously appreciate against ETH
4. Conservative 75% LTV protects against market volatility
Sophisticated yield optimization made simple.

As crypto traders absorb Bitcoin's rebound above $87,000 following the flash meltdown, AAVE climbs roughly 8% on Wednesday.

Despite institutional traders losing interest in risk assets, crypto market value is back over $2.9 trillion.

After Monday's market fall, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP rebound slowly.

The Aave lending protocol's native token, AAVE, is gaining on Wednesday as the crypto market rebounds from Monday's massacre. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP increase slightly as markets remain risk-averse ahead of the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

Trader excitement is low as the crypto world prepares for the inaugural White House Crypto Summit.
  Alternative.io
's crypto dread & Greed Index reads 20 on a scale of 0 to 100, indicating traders' dread.

At the time of writing, AAVE is up about 8%, while BTC, ETH, and XRP are behind.

Why is AAVE rising?

AAVE launched its lending markets on Sonic, a Fantom-based blockchain. The DeFi lending platform's 2025 Layer 1 growth was part of its strategy.

After the governance proposal was approved, AAVE version 3 was launched on Sonic Labs, resulting in a $33 million TVL gain in 24 hours.

Today, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP gain 1.21%, 3.15%, and 1.85%. The placement of XRP to the US Crypto Strategic Reserve prompted worries among X traders, raising arguments about its significance. However, the token is maintaining its over 8% seven-day gains and recovering slowly.

On Wednesday, Ethereum is at $2,100 and Bitcoin is nearing $90,000 barrier.

AAVE's daily chart Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rising and around 50. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates a bullish crossing, indicating AAVE's price trend is favorable, but smaller than the final week of February.

AAVE, the native token of the DeFi lending protocol, has seen an impressive surge of over 26% in just 24 hours, with current trading around $220. This rise is fueled by the introduction of a groundbreaking proposal from the Aave DAO that may significantly impact its future.
CoinMarketCap data indicates that AAVE's market capitalization has reached approximately $3.33 billion, while its 24-hour trading volume skyrocketed to $728.45 million. This momentum follows the announcement by Aave Chan Initiative's founder, revealing a vital Aave Request For Comment titled Aavenomics Implementation: Part One. This proposal aims to reshape Aave's tokenomics and revenue redistribution strategies.
The Aavenomics update focuses on the governance transition from LEND to AAVE, highlighting new economic strategies that will enhance liquidity and drive community engagement. A key aspect includes the formation of a four-member Aave Finance Committee tasked with financial management and oversight, ensuring proper allocation of the protocol's budget.
Part of the implementation will involve a robust buyback strategy, wherein the committee will acquire AAVE tokens from secondary markets, thereby reinforcing the ecosystem's reserves. Initial plans entail a $1 million weekly acquisition for the first six months.
Innovative features are also on the horizon, including the introduction of the Anti-GHO token, which serves as a protective measure for users during market volatility, alongside a new umbrella system designed for debt protection.
With Aave's cash reserves growing impressively to $115 million, the future looks promising for AAVE and its community. This pivotal moment in Aave's journey could signal new opportunities for investors in the DeFi space.

2. Using the deposited ETH as collateral on Ethereum, the user borrows $100k USDC on Base.
3. The user then borrows an additional $10k USDC on Polygon, still using the ETH collateral on Ethereum.
All of this happens without leaving the application or manually bridging assets.

Welcome to today's analysis! Let’s break down the current price action on $AAVE and what to expect next.

🌐 Overview: $AAVE Uptrend & Resistance Test
📈 After a downtrend, $AAVE is now in an uptrend and is approaching the red resistance zone, which is just above the previous lower high (LH).

🔄 Current Scenario:

$AAVE has already moved above the previous LH, signaling bullish momentum.
The next key step is breaking the red resistance zone to confirm further upside potential.
If the price breaks out, the first target is the blue line level.
🔑 Key Levels to Watch
🔴 Resistance Zone: Red Level (Needs breakout to confirm continued uptrend)
🔵 First Target: Blue Line Level (If breakout succeeds)

🛠️ Trade Scenarios
📌 Bullish Scenario (Breakout Above Resistance & Continuation to Blue Target)

If $AAVE breaks and holds above the red resistance zone, it could confirm a bullish continuation, moving toward the blue line target.
📌 Bearish Scenario (Rejection at Resistance & Retest of Support)

If $AAVE gets rejected at the red resistance, price could pull back for a retest before attempting another breakout.
📌 Conclusion
$AAVE is in an uptrend, and a breakout above the red resistance zone would confirm bullish continuation toward the blue target level. If the price gets rejected, a retest of lower support zones may follow before another breakout attempt.
