$CVX is currently at $2.71 (+6.01%), showing solid upward momentum after testing a 24h high of $3.046. Strong DeFi interest is driving this rally, with continued bullish potential if key resistance is broken.

Long Setup

🔶 $CRV Moves Straight Up

Instead of a pullback, $CRV went straight up, as I mentioned in my last tweets.

If we break past the red level, we could see major moves upward, which is why I’m happy holding my spot position.

🔶 Shorting Opportunity, Not Long

For trading, this is the time to consider shorting rather than longing, as many altcoins are hitting local upside targets/resistance.
$CVX Weakness and Devs’ Attention Needed

🔶 $CVX Lagging Behind

$CVX has been weak lately, but it generally follows the market trend.

I’m holding my spot position and will add more if we see a market-wide dip.

Stay cautious and watch those resistance levels!

What is TVL? 🤔 Total Value Locked represents all the assets that are currently staked in a specific decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. It's a critical metric that investors use to gauge the health and potential of a project.
📈 Why is TVL important?
Health Indicator: A high TVL indicates a healthy project with substantial assets under management, suggesting robust user trust and protocol stability.
Investor Confidence: The more value that is locked, the greater the confidence investors might have in the project's potential and security.
Value Generation: TVL can suggest that a protocol is capable of generating significant value for its users, attracting even more participation.",2025-04-02 15:14:31

Power Scalper signal on the 1H chart that could lead to another bullish move.

The Power Scalper signal is based on the RSI, SSL, and Trend Force Index.
