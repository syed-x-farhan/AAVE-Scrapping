@GetYieldFi
’s yUSD | USDC Balancer v3 Boosted Pool.
In one pool, LPs earn yield from
@pendle_fi
,
@spectra_finance
,
@Aave
, DEX trading fees, $BAL & $AURA emissions, plus extra $USDC incentives.
How?
In the fast-moving world of DeFi, it can be difficult for regular users to earn good risk-adjusted returns. YieldFi aims to solve this by being a fully onchain asset management platform, deploying deposits into high-quality DeFi protocols so that users can earn yield without needing to manually manage positions.
$yUSD is yield-bearing, currently ~21% APY, with backing fully transparent and onchain. Right now, there are three positions utilizing
@ResolvLabs
’ $USR to earn yield from Pendle and Spectra.
With Boosted Pools on
@Balancer
v3, the USDC portion of this pool gets deposited into
@Aave
, boosting baseline yields for LPs.
That’s how, with one easy-to-enter LP position, users earn yield from 7 different sources.

Another innovative addition is hooks, enabling customization of liquidity pool behavior based on specific conditions. For instance, the Stablesurge hook protects stable assets from de-pegging during volatile market conditions, ensuring smooth exchange operations. 🔒

), an automated market maker (AMM), has launched its most-recent upgrade, Balancer V3, on Arbitrum (
@arbitrum

With features such as customizable AMMs, 100% Boosted Pools, and Hooks, the launch is expected to strengthen Arbitrum’s position as a leading L2 blockchain in DeFi and Balancer's position as a leading AMM.
Balancer V3 features bring much-needed improvements to existing liquidity management systems.
🏊 Boosted Pools allow idle liquidity to be dynamically redirected to external lending markets, ensuring assets are readily available for trading.
Individual traders will benefit the most from lower slippage and better execution, while liquidity providers (LPs) can look forward to additional passive income.
🪝 Hooks will allow developers to customize pool functions via automated yield strategies and advanced risk controls.
For example, the StableSurge Hook adjusts swap fees to maintain stable-asset pegs during periods of market volatility.

The $BAL token has surged by +15.73%, reaching a high of $3.339 after breaking past key resistance levels. Currently consolidating around $2.973, the market is signaling potential for further volatility.

Entry Range:

If price pulls back: $2.850 - $2.920

If price rallies further: $3.000 - $3.050

Target Levels:

Target 1: $3.200

Target 2: $3.350

Stop Loss:

Place stop-loss at $2.750 to mitigate downside risks.

Current Outlook:

The sharp breakout from $2.481 to $3.339 suggests strong bullish momentum. Watch for a continuation toward $3.350, but remain cautious of pullbacks to test lower support.

💡 Consider locking in partial profits near $3.200, and let the rest ride to maximize gains!
