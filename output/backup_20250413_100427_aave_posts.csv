We’ve added a new section where $EYWA holders will soon be able to submit requests for future DAO votes.
👉
  t.co/yeEOipVeuC
Get ready to influence key decisions! First one is already there 👇
Proposals allow token holders to have more influence on what happens in the DAO and, as a consequence, on their own income from our DAO’s products such as CrossCurve. Voting starts two days after a proposal is published — so if a proposal goes up on a Monday, the voting will begin on Wednesday
Already, there is a live proposal: DAO EMISSON PROPOSAL
#1
. Itt sets an adjusted emission distribution of 1,262,295 $EYWA for the next quarter while keeping total emissions unchanged.
Speaking of emissions…
Emissions will be split:
🔹 50% on direct liquidity incentives
🔹 50% sent to Votemarket StakeDAO rewards
This will help secure additional CRV rewards, boost liquidity, and strengthen the DAO’s strategic position.

I wrote about this asset earlier. It broke the triangle to the downside, took liquidity, and now its fate depends on what happens in the next two days. I’ve marked the support area where we need to watch for the buyer—if they show activity, we might see another move to update the local high.

Overall, I don’t like what’s happening with Bitcoin dominance right now. For now, I’m only opening trades on Bitcoin.
