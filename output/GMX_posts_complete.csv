The token has reclaimed the important $12 level, with immediate resistance at $13. Support has formed at $11.50, which must hold to maintain bullish momentum. Technical indicators suggest the rally has room to continue before becoming overextended.

Technical Analysis in 3-Day Timeframe

GMX recently rebounded from its lower support trendline and is gearing up for a potential rally toward $40+.

The 21 MA is acting as temporary resistance, and once GMX breaks through this, it is likely to test the upper resistance at $45.

- Entry range: $22 to CMP.
- Close Position: If it breaks down below $22.
- Short-term Target: $42 to $58.
- Mid-term Target: $58 to $72.
- Long-term Target: $71 to $91.
