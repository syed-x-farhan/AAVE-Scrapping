Impressive news in the DeFi space as Scallop, a lending and borrowing protocol on the Sui blockchain, has achieved remarkable revenue of $79,920 within just 24 hours. This achievement places Scallop second only to Aave in the decentralized finance landscape, showcasing its growing influence in the Sui ecosystem and beyond.
Launched in May 2023, Sui has emerged as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, boasting low transaction fees and scalability, which are critical for the rapid growth of its DeFi applications. With a Total Value Locked surpassing $2 billion, Sui stands as a formidable competitor against established giants like $ETH and $SOL.
Scallop is making waves as the first DeFi protocol to receive an official grant from the Sui Foundation, supported by notable industry leaders. The platform has rapidly gained traction, with a Total Value Locked of approximately $130.27 million, marking a significant 34% increase in just one week. This growth reflects user confidence as Scallop continues to expand its offerings and community engagement.
Recent developments include partnerships that enhance its ecosystem, like the listing of the Walrus token and collaboration with Binance Wallet for yield-focused activities. Scallop Lend’s unique design encourages borrowing activity through a vote-escrow model, allowing users to earn higher rewards for staking its native token, $SCA.
With these advancements, Scallop is well-positioned to remain a significant player in the DeFi lending sector. The strategic partnerships and robust community support underline its potential in shaping the future of digital finance through innovative solutions.

Chainlink (LINK) has seen a tough Thursday as it faced an 8% dip in just 24 hours, primarily due to profit-taking after a momentary rise above $16. However, in an encouraging twist, key stakeholders have ramped up their holdings, adding an impressive 8.3% more LINK to their wallets over the past six months, hinting at a possible short-term price rebound.
Recent data highlights a notable uptick in Chainlink's social dominance, closely following a private meetup with significant US government leaders. Wallets containing between 10,000 and 10,000,000 LINK have swelled to an all-time high of 438.33 million LINK, which accounts for 43.8% of the total supply. This group of investors has stockpiled 26 million LINK tokens since September 2024, coinciding with a surge in social media chatter around LINK, indicating growing confidence among major players.
Moreover, Chainlink is leading in development activity within the real-world assets sector, outpacing competitors like Synthetix, Maker, and Dusk Foundation. The platform has recorded nearly 586 notable events on GitHub in the last month, underscoring its active development efforts.
On the ecosystem front, there’s exciting news as the Abu Dhabi Global Market has forged a partnership with Chainlink to establish regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets. This collaboration aims to leverage Chainlink's robust blockchain solutions to further innovation initiatives in the region.
In addition, the Aave DAO community has successfully integrated Chainlink’s Smart Value Recapture on the Ethereum Mainnet to combat oracle-related issues. This move is set to benefit DeFi applications by retaining value that was previously lost to blockchain networks.
Investors should watch for potential developments as Chainlink navigates these changes and rising interest.

The days of 1000% APYs and ponzinomics are fading. A new era of structured, scalable, and institutional-ready DeFi is here.
Let’s talk about what’s changing & what’s coming next. 🧵
A few years ago, DeFi was the Wild West:
⚡ High yields (but high risk)
🎭 Anonymous projects popping up daily
💰 Speculation driving insane returns
It was an experiment—and one that proved people wanted finance without middlemen.
Now, DeFi is evolving into a serious financial system.
🔺Institutions are integrating DeFi rails (banks testing Aave, Coinbase integrated Uniswap, BlackRock exploring yield strategies).
🔺Regulatory clarity is improving, allowing deeper adoption.
🔺Stablecoins & RWAs are bridging DeFi & TradFi.
This is the next phase.
DeFi isn’t just about speculation anymore—it’s becoming the backbone of real finance onchain. Stablecoins, real-world assets, and deeper liquidity are transforming how capital moves on-chain.
The next phase of DeFi is about scalability, efficiency, and integration with the broader financial system.
Avalanche is at the center of this shift.
With deep liquidity, cross-chain efficiency, and scalable DeFi infrastructure, it’s where institutions, builders, and traders are making the leap.
What’s coming next will change the game. 👀
Over the next few weeks, we’ll break down:
💵 The Evolution of Money → Stablecoins & FX liquidity
🌉 Bridged Assets → What they mean for DeFi
🏛️ RWAs → The institutional on-ramp to DeFi
📈 The Future of Trading → Perps, AI & structured yield
You won’t want to miss this. 🔥
This isn’t just another DeFi hype cycle. It’s the maturation of on-chain finance.
New assets. New liquidity. New opportunities.
The next era of DeFi is about to begin. Are you ready?
Follow along & stay tuned. Big things are coming.",2025-03-30 18:50:41

@aave
has officially integrated Chainlink SVR in a near-unanimous vote to recapture liquidation MEV, starting with an initial set of markets.
As the largest DeFi lending protocol, Aave is establishing a new standard in cryptoeconomics with SVR.
  www.prnewswire.com/news-releas...
🧵⬇️
Chainlink Smart Value Recapture (SVR) is a novel oracle solution that enables DeFi apps to recapture the non-toxic MEV derived from their use of Chainlink Price Feeds.
SVR was built in collaboration with
@bgdlabs
, Flashbots, &
@aave
DAO contributors.
👇
  blog.chain.link/chainlink-smar...
Chainlink SVR is powered by the same DON architecture that secures existing Chainlink Data Feeds & doesn’t require intermediary smart contracts.
SVR features enhanced redundancy through a “Dual Aggregator"" design, which uses non-SVR Chainlink Data Feeds as a fallback.
SVR introduces an additional source of fees for the Aave & Chainlink ecosystems, boosting the economic sustainability of DeFi.
Recaptured OEV fees will be split, starting with an initial 6-month discounted rate of 65% to the Aave ecosystem and 35% to the Chainlink ecosystem.
SVR is the first Chainlink service to be connected to Payment Abstraction.
Payment Abstraction is a cross-chain enabled payment system that enables service fees to be automatically converted into LINK, reducing payment friction in the Chainlink Network.
More info to come.
This is only the beginning.
A future implementation of SVR is planned to feature increased decentralization, enhanced gas efficiency, cross-chain capabilities, and more.

leveled up DeFi with Shade Agents powered by
@near_ai
and
@NEARProtocol
.
By splitting roles between a smart contract and a Worker Agent running in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Shade Agents bring both security and real-time intelligence to protocols like
@Aave
.
- Smart Contract Guardrails: Prepares a safe, rule-based transaction shell for Aave—no specifics, just structure.
- Worker Agent Flexibility: Fills in the blanks using real-time off-chain data (like borrowing 100 USDC at 5% APR).
- Bulletproof Security: Even if hacked, the Worker Agent can’t break the rules. Funds stay safe within Aave.
The result? Safer, smarter, scalable DeFi—powered by NEAR’s AI-ready, multichain-friendly design.

A whale recently added 43.5K $AAVE valued at $7.48M to FalconX after a long period of dormancy, sparking fears of a sell-off. AAVE, however, has registered a bullish reversal, creating a falling wedge pattern — a typical breakout sign!

Will the bulls drive AAVE above $190 resistance and target $400, or will whale pressure cause a breakdown? 📉📈

Honestly, it's disappointing to see one of DeFi's pioneers make such a centralized power move.
Uniswap Labs launched their Unichain L2 network with minimal input from the DAO that's supposed to govern it. They've poured $165.5 million into building and incentivizing it, while UNI token holders are left wondering what they're even holding tokens for.
Like - Uniswap has collected around $171 million in front-end fees over two years and hasn't shared any of that with token holders. Meanwhile, Aave and other protocols have figured out how to reward their communities.
It's like opening a restaurant with investors and then keeping all the profits for yourself while telling your investors they should be happy the restaurant exists. LOL.
And then there's the $21 million allocated to grow Unichain's TVL from $8.2 million to $750 million. This isn't bringing new money to the ecosystem - it's just reshuffling existing liquidity from Ethereum and other L2s. For everyday traders, this fragmentation means worse prices and more failed transactions as liquidity thins out across multiple chains.
The community backlash makes perfect sense. When you help build something revolutionary like Uniswap did for DeFi, you create certain expectations. This top-down approach feels like a betrayal of those ideals, and the market seems to agree - look at UNI.
This isn't just a Uniswap problem - it's a warning for all of DeFi. If we're just recreating the same power dynamics of traditional finance with different players, what's the point?
True decentralization means communities have real power, not just the illusion of it while founders make all the decisions that matter.",2025-03-30 19:00:33

• buy or mint lvlUSD with supported asset (I bought with USDC)
you can choose to stake your lvlUSD to earn yields that are distributed weekly. alternatively, you can supply lvlUSD/USDC liquidity in the Curve Finance pool for a 40x multiplier
how to deposit in the curve finance pool?
visit:

deposit your lvlUSD in the liquidity pool here. you don't need to have USDC cos single-sided LP works.
after a successful deposit, head back to the levelUSD page and navigate to the XP farming tab. deposit your LP token to start earning XP.

The World Liberty Financial Initiative (WLFI), a notable cryptocurrency project backed by US President Donald Trump, has successfully concluded its token sale, raising an impressive $590 million. This achievement puts WLFI among the top 10 largest token raises in history.
WLFI tokens were exclusively sold to accredited investors, meaning they cannot be freely traded or transferred to the public. As of now, there is no announced timeline for when WLFI tokens might be listed on exchanges. Launched in September 2024, the project aims to push decentralized finance (DeFi) forward while supporting US dollar-pegged stablecoins to bolster the USD's global dominance. At its core, WLFI features a DeFi lending platform.
The governance token, WLFI, opened for public sale on October 15, initially aiming to raise $300 million by selling 20 billion tokens at $0.015 each. However, demand was weaker than expected, leading to a revised fundraising goal of $30 million after just 766 million tokens sold, which brought in $11 million.
Interest in WLFI surged after the success of Trump-related meme coins like Official Trump (TRUMP) and Official Melania (MELANIA). By January 20, the initial sale wrapped up with 20% of the total supply sold. In response to increased demand, WLFI introduced an additional 5 billion tokens priced at $0.05 each, which quickly neared sellout by March 13.
WLFI token holders will receive governance rights over the WLF Protocol, although tokens will remain non-transferable for the first year after launch. Notable investor Justin Sun, founder of Tron, made headlines by buying $30 million worth of WLFI tokens in late November, securing his position as the top investor.
Despite the fundraising success, WLFI's portfolio of 9 crypto assets is currently battling a loss of $124 million. Major losses arise from Wrapped Bitcoin ($wBTC), Aave ($AAVE), and Tron ($TRX) amid a turbulent market week. Interestingly, WLFI's holdings are heavily invested in Ethereum ($ETH), accounting for 65% of its portfolio. The company acquired ETH at roughly $3,240 a token, but with prices dropping to around $1,900, this has significantly impacted overall portfolio losses.
