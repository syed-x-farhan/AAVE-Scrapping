Current Price: $0.85 (+10.53%)
24H Range: $0.77 ‚Äì $0.87
üîÑ Protocol Revival In Progress:
BAL has jumped 10.53% after Balancer Labs confirmed April 25th as the launch date for its long-anticipated V2 upgrade, bringing significant gas optimization and enhanced capital efficiency features. This protocol enhancement addresses previous criticisms and could revitalize Balancer's competitive position in the AMM space.
Key Levels:

Resistance: $0.87 (daily high), $0.90 (psychological barrier)
Support: $0.82 (intraday), $0.80 (previous resistance)
Power Zone: $0.88-$0.90 range must break for continuation to $1.00

Trade Setup:

Entry Zone: $0.84-$0.86 (current consolidation)
Pullback Entry: $0.80-$0.82 (value zone with lower risk)
Targets:

TP1: $0.90 (+6%)
TP2: $0.95 (+12%)
TP3: $1.00 (+18%)

Stop Loss: Below $0.77 (invalidation point)

Pro Tip:
BAL shows significant correlation (0.78) with broader DeFi index, suggesting sector momentum will influence continuation. The token's exchange balance has decreased 8.4% over 7 days, indicating strong accumulation. Leverage the Balancer protocol upgrade cycle ‚Äì historically, price peaks 2-3 days before actual implementation, suggesting optimal exit around April 22-23. Consider scaling in with 30% now, 40% on pullback to $0.82, and 30% on breakout confirmation above $0.88.",2025-04-13 09:57:57

In one pool, LPs earn yield from
@pendle_fi

,
@Aave
, DEX trading fees, $BAL & $AURA emissions, plus extra $USDC incentives.
How?
In the fast-moving world of DeFi, it can be difficult for regular users to earn good risk-adjusted returns. YieldFi aims to solve this by being a fully onchain asset management platform, deploying deposits into high-quality DeFi protocols so that users can earn yield without needing to manually manage positions.
$yUSD is yield-bearing, currently ~21% APY, with backing fully transparent and onchain. Right now, there are three positions utilizing
@ResolvLabs
‚Äô $USR to earn yield from Pendle and Spectra.
With Boosted Pools on
@Balancer
v3, the USDC portion of this pool gets deposited into
@Aave

@Balancer
), an automated market maker (AMM), has launched its most-recent upgrade, Balancer V3, on Arbitrum (
@arbitrum
).
With features such as customizable AMMs, 100% Boosted Pools, and Hooks, the launch is expected to strengthen Arbitrum‚Äôs position as a leading L2 blockchain in DeFi and Balancer's position as a leading AMM.
Balancer V3 features bring much-needed improvements to existing liquidity management systems.
üèä Boosted Pools allow idle liquidity to be dynamically redirected to external lending markets, ensuring assets are readily available for trading.
Individual traders will benefit the most from lower slippage and better execution, while liquidity providers (LPs) can look forward to additional passive income.
ü™ù Hooks will allow developers to customize pool functions via automated yield strategies and advanced risk controls.
For example, the StableSurge Hook adjusts swap fees to maintain stable-asset pegs during periods of market volatility.

The $BAL token has surged by +15.73%, reaching a high of $3.339 after breaking past key resistance levels. Currently consolidating around $2.973, the market is signaling potential for further volatility.

Entry Range:

If price pulls back: $2.850 - $2.920

If price rallies further: $3.000 - $3.050

Target Levels:

Target 1: $3.200

Target 2: $3.350

Stop Loss:

Place stop-loss at $2.750 to mitigate downside risks.

Current Outlook:

The sharp breakout from $2.481 to $3.339 suggests strong bullish momentum. Watch for a continuation toward $3.350, but remain cautious of pullbacks to test lower support.

337571657,Unknown,2024-07-01 22:56:51,1719874611625.0,"Introducing the Balancer v3 Codebase.
  medium.com/balancer-protocol/b...
1/ As we near feature completion for v3, we're opening the codebase to the broader ecosystem for feedback and contributions ahead of final audits.
Check out Balancer v3 at:
‚Ä¢ Codebase:
  github.com/balancer/balancer-v...
‚Ä¢ Documentation:
  docs-v3.balancer.fi/
2/Three years ago, we launched Balancer v2 to empower AMM innovation.
Although v2's versatility has been successful, its unopinionated architecture has resulted in complex custom pools, posing challenges for developers and integrators.
3/ Balancer v3 focuses on simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility.
New features include:
‚Ä¢ Redesigned Vault
‚Ä¢ Transient accounting system via EIP-1153
‚Ä¢ Re-entrant pool lifecycle hooks
‚Ä¢ Native support for yield-bearing tokens
‚Ä¢ 100% boosted pools
4/ The v3 Vault provides a flexible but opinionated definition for Balancer liquidity pools.
By integrating common design patterns from custom pools on v2, it ensures consistency across all pools types and significantly simplifies pool contracts.
5/ Key Vault features include:
‚Ä¢ Decimal scaling managed by the Vault
‚Ä¢ Rate scaling optimized for yield-bearing liquidity
‚Ä¢ Liquidity invariant approximation for unbalanced liquidity operations
‚Ä¢ Transient accounting with EIP-1153 support
6/ ‚Ä¢ ERC20MultiToken for atomic updates
‚Ä¢ Natively queryable to support complex operations
‚Ä¢ Standardized swap fee management
‚Ä¢ Pool creator fee to incentivize external AMM development
‚Ä¢ Native pool pause management
7/ v3 remains a platform for AMM experimentation, enabling custom pools to iterate on existing swap invariants or define entirely new ones.
By shifting core design patterns from the pool to the vault, v3 achieves a balance between flexibility, complexity, and streamlined DX.
8/ In addition to custom pools, v3 introduces a new hooks framework to extend existing pool types during key lifecycle points.
The v3 vault formalizes hook definitions and transient accounting enables secure vault reentrancy, unlocking an infinite design space.
9/ To showcase the potential of hooks, we‚Äôve put together some simple examples:
‚Ä¢ veBalDiscountHook
‚Ä¢ LotteryHook
‚Ä¢ ExitFeeHook
‚Ä¢ FeeTakingHook
This is just the tip of the iceberg and we‚Äôre excited to see what the broader ecosystem can create.
  github.com/balancer/balancer-v...
10/ First introduced in v2, Boosted Pools offered a novel solution to increase the capital efficiency of passive LPs.
The first iteration was constrained by the v2 vault architecture. However, with the innovations in v3, gas-efficient 100% Boosted Pools are now possible.
11/ In v3, Boosted Pools simplify swaps without needing BPT nesting. Instead, yield-bearing tokens are registered directly with the pool.
To facilitate gas-efficient swaps, v3 also introduces the concept of Buffers.
12/ Buffers act as two-token pools holding yield-bearing tokens and their underlying counterparts.
Swaps pass through Buffers, avoiding external calls if liquidity allows. For larger swaps, Buffers handle wrap/unwrap actions, ensuring LPs have 100% exposure to (YB) assets.
13/ Balancer v3 aims to provide a robust foundation to facilitate the creation of innovative products through its powerful and permissionless infrastructure.
14/ The simplification of custom pool development and the introduction of hooks reduce development time and effort required, making it easier for developers to innovate and bring new products to market.
To support this, the Balancer DAO is hosting the following initiatives.
15/ ‚Ä¢ Grants: The grants program will offer up to 150k $BAL over the next 6 months for projects building implementations on Balancer v3.
‚Ä¢ Hooks Bounty Program: To encourage experimentation, Balancer Grants will be offering bounties for contributors creating new hooks on v3.
16/ v3 is about building for a better future and while the breadth of specific products that will emerge remains to be seen, it is up to the financial pioneers of our era to define the future landscape of DeFi.

For most, this pool probably wouldn‚Äôt be given a second thought but it‚Äôs actually incredibly interesting. It perfectly highlights how
@Balancer
can act as a base layer AMM for innovations to be built on top of.
Why is it so interesting? Or, what even is it?
@GyroStable
has built Elliptic Liquidity Pools (E-CLPs) which improves capital efficiency over traditional stableswap pools. They do this by not providing liquidity significantly above peg for assets that should trade 1-1.
There‚Äôs more nuance to it, but that‚Äôs the gist. Here‚Äôs a quick explainer of E-CLPs ‚Üí

This recent sDAI-aUSDC gauge is an extension of a Gyroscope E-CLP called a Rehype Pool. Rehype Pools automatically deposit funds into
@Aave
, allowing LPs to earn yield from three sources.
Swap fees from the pool
Lending yields from Aave
Token incentives from Balancer and Aura
With sDAI currently yielding 10% and the elevated cost of borrowing on Aave, this pool will have a great baseline yield.
