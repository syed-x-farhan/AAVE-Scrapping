Before diving into USH’s specific mechanisms, it's helpful to compare it with other decentralized stablecoins like DAI and GHO, which don't include a built-in redemption mechanism. Those stablecoins rely entirely on traders, arbitrageurs, market makers, and minters stepping in when their value dips below $1, believing it will naturally return to its intended value.
While effective on highly liquid blockchains with active markets, this model wouldn’t work well in the current MultiversX environment, where professional and sophisticated participants as well as fundamental component for their activities are still to be built. Without enough arbitrage activity and proactive minters, this soft-peg system alone can't maintain stability. USH addresses this issue by incorporating a redemption mechanism that acts as an extra safeguard, helping to keep its value stable when market dynamics alone are insufficient.
Understanding USH’s Design
Let's now examine why USH was designed this way, the advantages it offers, and its current limitations:
Unlike the stability fee model used by DAI (which adjusts borrowing costs to balance stablecoin supply and demand), USH uses a redemption mechanism. This guarantees that each USH token always maintains a value close to $1, because the protocol guarantees you can always exchange it back for exactly $1 worth of collateral.
The redemption mechanism serves as an automatic safety net or a self-correcting feature if the ecosystem can't balance itself naturally. When there's too much USH circulating and its value falls below $1 (known as a ""depeg""), redemptions encourage reducing the supply, helping restore balance. It's important to note that just issuing stablecoins doesn't automatically create liquidity, and real equilibrium only occurs when the amount issued matches market demand.
Unlike centralized stablecoins, which are directly backed one-for-one with dollars (FIAT), decentralized stablecoins like USH are backed by volatile crypto assets, meaning minting these tokens implies the creation of debt. This introduces a responsibility to maintain sufficient collateral, with liquidation mechanisms in place to prevent any risk of accumulating bad debt or under-collateralization.
This means that positions need to be individualized, as each one has different collateralization parameters and therefore risk.
When debt is created, redemptions could work in two ways:
• Each user sees an equal share of his debt repaid and loses an equivalent part of his collateral. Meaning that redemption is socialized to all participants.
• Specific users are individually targeted.
If redemption were evenly spread among all users, for example, if 0.1% of the total supply was redeemed, and everyone lost exactly 0.1% of their collateral, no user would have the chance to avoid redemption. This would remove the motivation for users to voluntarily rebalance supply and demand, as everyone would be affected equally regardless of their actions.
In this scenario, redemptions would become a shared burden, meaning no single user would feel individually responsible for restoring the stablecoin’s balance, since everyone would bear the cost equally.
This is why USH uses individual redemptions. Specifically targeting users closest to their borrowing limits motivates them to either increase their collateral or repay part of their debt to protect their assets. When users actively manage their positions this way, the whole system stabilizes naturally and relies less on frequent redemptions.
Over time, this approach naturally brings borrowing limits down to a balanced level where stablecoin supply matches demand. As confidence grows in the stablecoin’s stability, redemptions become less frequent, and borrowing limits can safely rise again.
Today, various stablecoin models exist, each emphasizing different priorities:
• Redeeming from users with the highest borrow limits encourages higher overall collateral in the system, limiting recourse to liquidation (used by Liquity V1).
• Redeeming from users with the lowest borrowing rates boosts the protocol’s earnings, allowing it to incentivize future liquidity and demand, especially as total debt grows larger than available supply (used by Liquity V2).
With USH, we've combined elements of both models. Since the collateral used generates staking rewards, this allows us to provide extra incentives for liquidity. Essentially, the better collateralized the entire protocol is, the more rewards can be distributed to users relative to the total circulating supply of USH.
Therefore, we've chosen a 0% borrowing rate with no initial minting fee, and redemptions that target users based on how close they are to their borrowing limits.
Current Challenges
Now that we've covered the theory, let's look at the challenges we've encountered and the solutions currently being considered.
Initially, redemptions weren't very effective due to limited participation, insufficient liquidity, and a general lack of awareness about arbitrage opportunities between sEGLD and EGLD pool on Ashswap. Additionally, high fees related to complex trades made redemptions less profitable.
We had initially designed the redemptions to force a buyback of USH, to ensure that their efficiency had a direct positive impact on the peg. However, while this approach has benefits, it only creates buying pressure during brief moments when redemptions are immediately profitable, rather than providing consistent buying support over longer periods.
Additionally, the original method made users feel that redemptions didn’t directly protect the dollar value of their positions because they couldn't redeem USH directly and instead, they had to swap it for EGLD to regain their original exposure.
The first solution was creating a simple, user-friendly redemption interface that anyone could use without technical expertise. Unlike automated redemption bots, regular users often just want to acquire collateral (sEGLD) at a lower price rather than complete complex arbitrage strategies. Because of this, regular users have a lower threshold for profitability, making redemptions attractive even under less favorable conditions.
Similarly, users who want to liquid-stake their EGLD tokens are now automatically directed to AshSwap if that allows them to get more sEGLD.
These improvements have significantly boosted redemption reliability and efficiency in maintaining USH’s peg. Additionally, they allow everyday users and not just automated bots to benefit from these opportunities.
However, a key challenge remains: redemption currently occurs too frequently. While the peg is strong, the rapid supply turnover means users must actively monitor and manage their positions if they wish to maintain consistent exposure to EGLD. This high frequency is partly due to limited efficient market-making activities, which means EGLD's price fluctuations have a strong impact, both positive and negative on USH’s peg.
When the price of EGLD rises, it usually happens first on centralized exchanges (CEXs), as they have higher trading volumes and more liquidity. This initially creates a price difference, making EGLD temporarily cheaper on MultiversX. Traders notice this and move USDC onto MultiversX, buy EGLD at a lower price, and sell it on centralized exchanges for a profit. This arbitrage activity quickly brings prices back into alignment .
A similar process occurs with USH. When EGLD’s price goes up externally, the EGLD<>USH liquidity pool on MultiversX needs more USH tokens to match this new price. As a result, more USDC ends up accumulating in the USH<>USDC pool, strengthening and stabilizing USH’s peg.
Conversely, when EGLD’s price drops significantly, the EGLD price in the EGLD<>USH liquidity pool can differ substantially from the real EGLD price (the oracle price in USD). If this price difference becomes large enough to cross a predefined redemption threshold, users have a financial incentive to buy USH and redeem it for collateral. This redemption activity helps push USH’s price back up towards $1, effectively acting as a ""market maker of last resort"" as a backup mechanism that kicks in whenever normal market activities aren’t enough to manage EGLD’s volatility and protect USH’s peg.
One of the core ideas behind this system was to position USH not only as a pathway to USDC liquidity but as a driving force within the ecosystem itself, one that doesn't depend solely on centralized stablecoins for growth. Redemptions are extremely important, as they help keep USH’s circulating supply balanced, aligned with what the ecosystem can sustainably support while leaving room for natural, organic growth based on the overall strength of the ecosystem.
The Path Moving Forward
To address these issues, we're currently exploring several potential improvements:
1. Direct USH Redemption with Small Fee
First, we're considering allowing direct redemption of USH tokens, charging only a small redemption fee. This would encourage users to buy USH anytime its value falls below $1 and not just when immediate profit opportunities appear through the current redemption process. Users would have the assurance that they'll always get back at least 99.5% of their dollar value (assuming a small 0.5% fee). This approach would also help recently redeemed users regain their collateral directly, avoiding the extra step of swapping tokens. Additionally, this could address extreme situations where there isn't enough liquidity available to buy back collateral efficiently, preventing larger losses.
This new redemption option would complement the current model. The existing redemption strategy would remain active but with a lower trigger threshold, such as around $0.98. In this way, the current model becomes purely a safety net rather than the primary method for controlling the peg.
2. Dynamic Minting Fees During Depeg
Next, we're looking into adding a dynamic upfront minting fee whenever USH's price falls below $1 (a depeg). Currently, there's no direct discouragement for minting USH during a depeg, potentially adding unnecessary selling pressure exactly when USH supply needs to decrease. Right now, someone minting USH at $0.99 doesn't immediately experience a loss unless USH rises again above this price. Introducing a fee tied to the level of the depeg would create a stronger incentive to avoid minting when USH is below its target, thus stabilizing the supply more quickly and efficiently.
3. Separate Redemption Prioritization for Liquidity Providers
Finally, we're evaluating a new way to prioritize redemptions. Right now, many users mint USH to participate in liquidity pools to earn incentives, but frequent redemptions make this strategy unpredictable. One idea is creating a separate ""Isolated Pool"" specifically for liquidity providers. This would allow redemption priority to differ based on user behaviour.
This setup would result in two separate redemption lists. Regular borrowers (those creating leveraged or long positions, for example) often affect USH’s stability significantly, while liquidity providers help support the overall stability of the system. Redemptions would continue to occur in order of borrowing limits (highest to lowest), but liquidity providers would only face redemption after all regular borrowers have been redeemed first.
We still need to carefully study the implications of this change. It's important to note that for users uncomfortable with the redemption mechanism, simply buying USH directly from secondary markets to build liquidity positions might be a healthier alternative. Doing so adds helpful buying pressure when USH is below $1 and offers extra profit opportunities as USH returns to its intended value.
Our immediate next step is determining the benefits that this new ranking mechanism could bring, when clarifying the incentive not necessarily to mint USH to participate in the Liquidity Provision might be sufficient and avoid adding further complexity.
Partners who participated in providing the initial liquidity for USH will be able to migrate their positions into a second Isolated Protocol starting next week. This will allow them to maintain their positions without being subject to redemptions while we finalize the development of the upcoming feature. As key contributors to USH's stability, their participation is essential, and this measure will ensure they can continue supporting the ecosystem without disruption.
In addition to these first 3 pillars, we are also considering research into facilitating market making by our own means by having working capital in EGLD, USDC, and USH, capable of responding to a certain volatility while remaining at least dollar-value neutral. In any case, if you have the necessary knowledge and would like to participate on your own in this kind of activity, don't hesitate to contact us on the Hatom Dev Telegram, we'll be delighted to help you :
