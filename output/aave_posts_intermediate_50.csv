#10
We are connecting the dots that create smarter investors and boost investment success. Each week, we share our efforts and progress towards this goal. We are committed to keeping our community informed on what goes on behind the scenes. As the market continues on the path of recovery, we are honing the tools in our ecosystem and building new ones according to what is required in the dynamic crypto market.
We are diversifying and moving deeper into DeFAI and InfoFi as a tooling mechanism for crypto investors. This week, we made significant progress.
Here‚Äôs the 10th edition of our weekly development update
¬ª Attention Index: Following the launch of the Attention Index tab and associated features, we are reviewing the performance in Prod. and deploying fixes where needed. We are also studying user behaviour to ensure that the tool meets the user's requirements. This week, we integrated the ‚Äòoverall mentions‚Äô parameter to the tab to present further information on social activity for featured tokens. We also added data on real-time changes in holder count.
¬ª Dexplore: Our blockchain search engine continues to get smarter and faster. The training process continues as we add more information to the model‚Äôs library and optimize the performance for faster inferences. We fixed critical bugs and also modified the UI for a better outlook and experience.
¬ª CHECK: This week, we announced CHECK, a progressive reward system for X users contributing to important discussions. Development is already underway for the platform! We hope to share more information on this in subsequent updates.
¬ª Liquidity Boost on Pancakeswap: The $DCK token is native to
@BNBCHAIN
and tradable on
@pancakeSwap
. This week, we added more assets to the tune of $100,000 to the DCK/BUSD pair.
¬ª KOL Tracker and Performance Index: We updated the logic for the KOL tracker and performance index to enable the algorithm to track posts without cash tags. This will significantly improve the accuracy of information generated by both tools.
¬ª New integrations: We completed integrations for
@pumpdotfun
‚Äôs new AMM. Users can now track activity on the protocol via DexCheck.
¬ª UI Improvements: We also improved the platform‚Äôs design in key areas to adjust to best design practices and improve user experience. You‚Äôll notice major changes in the outlook of the Wallet Analyzer and Token Analytics tools.
¬ª Address Tagging: We are adding labels to unique wallets for identification. This week, we deprecated the old tagging system, tested the new tagging script for Ethereum addresses, and added PnL-based tags for BNB Chain addresses. We also added tags Tron and Ton network addresses.
¬ª Optimizations for existing tools: We are working on major updates for InsightsGPT/ Smart Traders Moves. We are also integrating new changes for Wallet Analyzer across every network supported on the platform.
DexCheck is designed to bring out the best in every trader. With every update and launch, this statement becomes even more realistic.

In the coming week and month, we will continue in this direction and evolve according to users‚Äô and market demand.",2025-04-01 21:05:02

1Ô∏è‚É£ Deflationary Tokens (Scarcity Play)
Mechanism: Supply decreases over time (via burns, buybacks, etc.), often paired with demand-generating utilities (staking, fees, etc.).
Examples: BTC (post-halving supply squeeze), BNB (quarterly burns), ETH (post-EIP-1559 fee burns).
-Pros: Scarcity drives price appreciation if demand holds, incentivizes holding, combats sell pressure.
-Cons: Risk of over-speculation (burns ‚â† intrinsic value), liquidity challenges if supply shrinks too fast.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Inflationary Tokens (Growth Play)
Mechanism: Supply increases over time (emissions, rewards, etc.) to fund ecosystems, reward users, or maintain liquidity.
Examples: DOGE (uncapped supply), SOL (inflationary staking rewards), DeFi farming tokens (e.g., SUSHI, CAKE).
-Pros: Funds protocol growth (developer incentives, liquidity mining), encourages participation (staking, farming), offers flexible monetary policy.
-Cons: Dilution risk if demand doesn‚Äôt match supply, requires high utility to sustain value.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Fixed-Supply Tokens (Predictability Play)
Mechanism: Total supply capped at launch (no minting or burning), relies purely on demand dynamics.
Examples: LTC (84M cap), XRP (100B fixed, but escrowed releases), memecoins (e.g., SHIB‚Äôs 589T fixed supply).
-Pros: Transparent, predictable economics, no dilution concerns, simpler for regulatory compliance.
-Cons: Inflexible (can‚Äôt adjust to market needs), risks stagnation without utility.
Which Model Wins?
Store of value: Deflationary (BTC, ETH).
Ecosystem growth: Inflationary (SOL, DeFi tokens).
Compliance/niche use: Fixed-supply (XRP, memecoins).
Wildcard: Hybrid models (e.g., ETH‚Äôs burn + staking rewards) are gaining traction.
