Impressive news in the DeFi space as Scallop, a lending and borrowing protocol on the Sui blockchain, has achieved remarkable revenue of $79,920 within just 24 hours. This achievement places Scallop second only to Aave in the decentralized finance landscape, showcasing its growing influence in the Sui ecosystem and beyond.
Launched in May 2023, Sui has emerged as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, boasting low transaction fees and scalability, which are critical for the rapid growth of its DeFi applications. With a Total Value Locked surpassing $2 billion, Sui stands as a formidable competitor against established giants like $ETH and $SOL.
Scallop is making waves as the first DeFi protocol to receive an official grant from the Sui Foundation, supported by notable industry leaders. The platform has rapidly gained traction, with a Total Value Locked of approximately $130.27 million, marking a significant 34% increase in just one week. This growth reflects user confidence as Scallop continues to expand its offerings and community engagement.
Recent developments include partnerships that enhance its ecosystem, like the listing of the Walrus token and collaboration with Binance Wallet for yield-focused activities. Scallop Lend‚Äôs unique design encourages borrowing activity through a vote-escrow model, allowing users to earn higher rewards for staking its native token, $SCA.
With these advancements, Scallop is well-positioned to remain a significant player in the DeFi lending sector. The strategic partnerships and robust community support underline its potential in shaping the future of digital finance through innovative solutions.

The days of 1000% APYs and ponzinomics are fading. A new era of structured, scalable, and institutional-ready DeFi is here.
Let‚Äôs talk about what‚Äôs changing & what‚Äôs coming next. üßµ
A few years ago, DeFi was the Wild West:
‚ö° High yields (but high risk)
üé≠ Anonymous projects popping up daily
üí∞ Speculation driving insane returns
It was an experiment‚Äîand one that proved people wanted finance without middlemen.
Now, DeFi is evolving into a serious financial system.
üî∫Institutions are integrating DeFi rails (banks testing Aave, Coinbase integrated Uniswap, BlackRock exploring yield strategies).
üî∫Regulatory clarity is improving, allowing deeper adoption.
üî∫Stablecoins & RWAs are bridging DeFi & TradFi.
This is the next phase.
DeFi isn‚Äôt just about speculation anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming the backbone of real finance onchain. Stablecoins, real-world assets, and deeper liquidity are transforming how capital moves on-chain.
The next phase of DeFi is about scalability, efficiency, and integration with the broader financial system.
Avalanche is at the center of this shift.
With deep liquidity, cross-chain efficiency, and scalable DeFi infrastructure, it‚Äôs where institutions, builders, and traders are making the leap.
What‚Äôs coming next will change the game. üëÄ
Over the next few weeks, we‚Äôll break down:
üíµ The Evolution of Money ‚Üí Stablecoins & FX liquidity
üåâ Bridged Assets ‚Üí What they mean for DeFi
üèõÔ∏è RWAs ‚Üí The institutional on-ramp to DeFi
üìà The Future of Trading ‚Üí Perps, AI & structured yield
You won‚Äôt want to miss this. üî•
This isn‚Äôt just another DeFi hype cycle. It‚Äôs the maturation of on-chain finance.
New assets. New liquidity. New opportunities.
The next era of DeFi is about to begin. Are you ready?

has officially integrated Chainlink SVR in a near-unanimous vote to recapture liquidation MEV, starting with an initial set of markets.
As the largest DeFi lending protocol, Aave is establishing a new standard in cryptoeconomics with SVR.
  www.prnewswire.com/news-releas...
üßµ‚¨áÔ∏è
Chainlink Smart Value Recapture (SVR) is a novel oracle solution that enables DeFi apps to recapture the non-toxic MEV derived from their use of Chainlink Price Feeds.
SVR was built in collaboration with
@bgdlabs
, Flashbots, &
@aave
DAO contributors.
üëá
  blog.chain.link/chainlink-smar...
Chainlink SVR is powered by the same DON architecture that secures existing Chainlink Data Feeds & doesn‚Äôt require intermediary smart contracts.
SVR features enhanced redundancy through a ‚ÄúDual Aggregator"" design, which uses non-SVR Chainlink Data Feeds as a fallback.
SVR introduces an additional source of fees for the Aave & Chainlink ecosystems, boosting the economic sustainability of DeFi.
Recaptured OEV fees will be split, starting with an initial 6-month discounted rate of 65% to the Aave ecosystem and 35% to the Chainlink ecosystem.
SVR is the first Chainlink service to be connected to Payment Abstraction.
Payment Abstraction is a cross-chain enabled payment system that enables service fees to be automatically converted into LINK, reducing payment friction in the Chainlink Network.
More info to come.
This is only the beginning.
A future implementation of SVR is planned to feature increased decentralization, enhanced gas efficiency, cross-chain capabilities, and more.
