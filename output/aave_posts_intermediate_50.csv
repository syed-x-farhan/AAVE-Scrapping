Here’s the answer: every time a big chunk o$CAKE gets unlocked, it increases the circulating supply — and that creates sell pressure.
This chart shows it clearly: as the total locked amount (veCAKE + old pool) goes down, the CAKE/BNB ratio also drops.
Even when $BNB or the market was pumping$CAKE couldn’t follow. Why? Because unlockings increased supply without enough demand to absorb it.

#10
We are connecting the dots that create smarter investors and boost investment success. Each week, we share our efforts and progress towards this goal. We are committed to keeping our community informed on what goes on behind the scenes. As the market continues on the path of recovery, we are honing the tools in our ecosystem and building new ones according to what is required in the dynamic crypto market.
We are diversifying and moving deeper into DeFAI and InfoFi as a tooling mechanism for crypto investors. This week, we made significant progress.
Here’s the 10th edition of our weekly development update
» Attention Index: Following the launch of the Attention Index tab and associated features, we are reviewing the performance in Prod. and deploying fixes where needed. We are also studying user behaviour to ensure that the tool meets the user's requirements. This week, we integrated the ‘overall mentions’ parameter to the tab to present further information on social activity for featured tokens. We also added data on real-time changes in holder count.
» Dexplore: Our blockchain search engine continues to get smarter and faster. The training process continues as we add more information to the model’s library and optimize the performance for faster inferences. We fixed critical bugs and also modified the UI for a better outlook and experience.
» CHECK: This week, we announced CHECK, a progressive reward system for X users contributing to important discussions. Development is already underway for the platform! We hope to share more information on this in subsequent updates.
» Liquidity Boost on Pancakeswap: The $DCK token is native to
@BNBCHAIN
and tradable on
@pancakeSwap
. This week, we added more assets to the tune of $100,000 to the DCK/BUSD pair.
» KOL Tracker and Performance Index: We updated the logic for the KOL tracker and performance index to enable the algorithm to track posts without cash tags. This will significantly improve the accuracy of information generated by both tools.
» New integrations: We completed integrations for
@pumpdotfun
’s new AMM. Users can now track activity on the protocol via DexCheck.
» UI Improvements: We also improved the platform’s design in key areas to adjust to best design practices and improve user experience. You’ll notice major changes in the outlook of the Wallet Analyzer and Token Analytics tools.
» Address Tagging: We are adding labels to unique wallets for identification. This week, we deprecated the old tagging system, tested the new tagging script for Ethereum addresses, and added PnL-based tags for BNB Chain addresses. We also added tags Tron and Ton network addresses.
» Optimizations for existing tools: We are working on major updates for InsightsGPT/ Smart Traders Moves. We are also integrating new changes for Wallet Analyzer across every network supported on the platform.
DexCheck is designed to bring out the best in every trader. With every update and launch, this statement becomes even more realistic. This month, we launched two primary features and several add-ons to existing tools. In the coming week and month, we will continue in this direction and evolve according to users’ and market demand.",2025-04-02 12:34:06
