As the largest DeFi lending protocol, Aave is introducing a new era in cryptoeconomics by using SVR to increase Aave protocol revenue while supporting the security and sustainability of the oracle infra that Aave has relied on for 5+ years & powers DeFi.
Payment Abstraction ultimately reduces payment friction in the Chainlink Network, while maximizing the Chainlink Network‚Äôs cryptoeconomic security and sustainability by leveraging LINK as a singular Universal Gas Token for service payments and staking.
We‚Äôre also excited to share that the first phase of the Chainlink Build claims mechanism is code-complete and expected to launch this year.

üî∫Institutions are integrating DeFi rails (banks testing Aave, Coinbase integrated Uniswap, BlackRock exploring yield strategies).
üî∫Regulatory clarity is improving, allowing deeper adoption.
üî∫Stablecoins & RWAs are bridging DeFi & TradFi.
This is the next phase.
DeFi isn‚Äôt just about speculation anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming the backbone of real finance onchain. Stablecoins, real-world assets, and deeper liquidity are transforming how capital moves on-chain.
The next phase of DeFi is about scalability, efficiency, and integration with the broader financial system.
Avalanche is at the center of this shift.
With deep liquidity, cross-chain efficiency, and scalable DeFi infrastructure, it‚Äôs where institutions, builders, and traders are making the leap.
What‚Äôs coming next will change the game. üëÄ
Over the next few weeks, we‚Äôll break down:
üíµ The Evolution of Money ‚Üí Stablecoins & FX liquidity
üåâ Bridged Assets ‚Üí What they mean for DeFi
üèõÔ∏è RWAs ‚Üí The institutional on-ramp to DeFi
üìà The Future of Trading ‚Üí Perps, AI & structured yield
You won‚Äôt want to miss this. üî•
This isn‚Äôt just another DeFi hype cycle. It‚Äôs the maturation of on-chain finance.
New assets. New liquidity. New opportunities.
The next era of DeFi is about to begin. Are you ready?

  t.co/wupr2lmcmk
, MEXC, and Uniswap.
After successfully raising $3.84 million through a community-focused Dutch auction model, Kinto shows its commitment to fair tokenomics. This approach reduces speculation and assures a transparent valuation with community participation. The recent backing by major institutional players, including a $20 million investment from Brevan Howard Digital, demonstrates growing confidence in Kinto's model for compliant on-chain finance.
Kinto stands out by integrating KYC and AML processes directly into the blockchain, ensuring both institutional and individual users can engage with DeFi while meeting regulatory requirements. This exchange model emphasizes security and user control, allowing for on-chain transactions without the risks associated with centralized platforms.
The $K token is designed for long-term sustainability, with 70% of the total supply dedicated to community members. Token holders will benefit from governance rights and incentives such as reduced trading fees and priority access to liquidity pools, creating an ecosystem that promotes user engagement and collaboration.
As the landscape of decentralized finance evolves, Kinto's innovation in financial infrastructure paves the way toward sustainable growth, shifting the focus from short-term speculation to genuine utility.
Stay tuned for the launch and prepare for what Kinto has to offer in your crypto journey.

356684848,Unknown,2025-03-27 12:31:42,1743078702802.0,"Base is unstoppable right now.
It‚Äôs pulled in $7.9B of net inflows over the past year ‚Äî more than double its closest rival ‚Äî and is now fourth in revenue behind chains twice its age, all without even dropping a token.
Better yet,
@base
has a knack for staying on trend ‚Äî leading onchain yields when Ethereum rallies, embracing AI with Virtuals and Clanker, and scooping up meme momentum when Solana cools. And it doesn‚Äôt look to be slowing down.
Here are three areas where Base is holding court.üëá
~~ Analysis by
@davewardonline
~~
1Ô∏è‚É£ Home Base Advantage
Unlike other upstart rollups that have to hustle for brand recognition and the pitch of superior tech, Base can plug directly into parent
@Coinbase
‚Äôs massive user base and trusted brand. This not only has meant tapping into the power of an always-on marketing engine and a clear pipeline for acquiring users, but also lays the foundation for developing a unique suite of hybrid, onchain/offchain products.
Verified Pools
The most recent example of this synergy is Verified Pools: specialized liquidity venues built on Uniswap v4 and Base, open only to Coinbase-KYC'd users.
‚Ä¢ People in the U.S., Singapore, the Netherlands, the BVI, the Cayman Islands, and the Channel Islands all get to join in.
‚Ä¢ Currently available pools are: EURC / USDC, ETH / USDC, cbBTC / USDC, cbBTC / ETH, cbETH / ETH.
Optimized by risk-management firm
@gauntlet_xyz
, these pools offer a way for institutions (via Coinbase Prime) and retail (via
@CoinbaseWallet
) to enjoy better liquidity in a compliance-friendly way. If you‚Äôre arriving from TradFi, this setup offers the speed and flexibility of DeFi with the comfort of trusted oversight.
Bitcoin-Backed Loans
Beyond this, in January, Coinbase rolled out a new service for U.S. users (minus those in New York) to borrow up to $100K in $USDC using their $BTC as collateral, all on Base.
‚Ä¢ These come with no strict repayment date, but keep your loan-to-value ratio under 86% to avoid liquidation, and interest rates hover around 4‚Äì6%.
‚Ä¢ Over $65M in $BTC is already locked up, powering ~$33M in active loans.
How does this work? BTC is automatically converted into cbBTC and deposited into
@MorphoLabs
, before you receive $USDC in under a minute. It‚Äôs Coinbase‚Äôs second attempt at Bitcoin-backed lending after shelving their 2023 version.
Coinbase One Rewards
Additionally, the firm's Coinbase One premium subscription is another hybrid, onchain/offchain offering where the exchange provides perks on its L2.
‚Ä¢ You get $10/month in free gas on Base (or unlimited if you shell out for Premium at $299.99/month).
‚Ä¢ Higher yields or extra incentives on DeFi platforms like Moonwell, Aerodrome, Morpho, and PancakeSwap.
By weaving in all these perks, Coinbase encourages its existing 600K subscribers to explore and transact on Base, further smoothing the experience of moving onchain.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Stacking Tech Advances
But Base‚Äôs advantage doesn‚Äôt just come from brand power, it‚Äôs also evolving on the technical front to ensure its network is the best to use ‚Äì and to build on.
Flashblocks
Slated for mainnet around Q2 2025 (currently on testnet), Flashblocks are designed to make transactions on Base incredibly fast ‚Äî cutting them from 2 seconds to 200 milliseconds. Think of it as giving your transactions a ‚Äúhead start,‚Äù so you don‚Äôt have to wait around for confirmations.
‚Ä¢ It borrows from Solana‚Äôs ‚Äúshred-style‚Äù approach and Celestia‚Äôs data squares, plus an MEV-awareness factor courtesy of research organization Flashbots.
‚Ä¢ It offers built-in protections against transactions failures, making the entire Base experience quicker and more reliable.
This is big news for gaming, high-frequency trading, and any other scenario where real-time confirmations matter, potentially expanding the chain‚Äôs overall offerings.
Smart Wallet Sub-Accounts
Another upgrade for the network will be to their smart wallets (debuted last year) in the form of Sub-Accounts, currently in testnet and expected in Q2 2025.
‚Ä¢ With Sub-Accounts, multiple addresses (for NFTs, yield-farming, everyday spending, etc.) can be bundled under a single wallet interface.
‚Ä¢ Set spending limits and permissions can be preset to avoid pop-up transaction spam.
It‚Äôs all built on a new ERC standard from Base, which means devs can integrate it seamlessly if they want to. For new users, this could help tame the complexity of wallets which still scare many people away from onchain life.
Base Appchains
Finally, there‚Äôs Base Appchains, specialized Layer 3 networks for specific apps that want more customization. Unlike a typical shared chain, these Appchains leverage the same OP Stack as Base but with a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) approach for near-instant bridging and dedicated blockspace.
‚Ä¢ They run on Base‚Äôs infrastructure, letting devs customize gas tokens, fees, and blockspace for their own needs while maintaining security.
‚Ä¢ Early adopters include
@BLOCKLORDS
,
@SuperChampsHQ
, and
@Metacade_
on the gaming side, plus projects like Proof 8, MVL,
@horizenglobal
, and
@DCP_Foundation
, which explore everything from real-world data to privacy and art.
It‚Äôs a big piece of Base‚Äôs long-term plan for modular scaling: give projects that want it their own environment ‚Äî complete with hardware-enforced security from TEEs ‚Äî without forcing them to sacrifice the liquidity and user base that Base provides. Essentially, you can tailor your own ‚Äúmini blockchain‚Äù (an ever-growing narrative in the wake of Hyperliquid‚Äôs success) and still enjoy smooth, near-instant bridging back to Base.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Stablecoin Success
Yet another huge area of growth for Base has been its establishment as a premier place for stablecoin transfers.
While onchain high-speed arbitrage strategies, memecoin speculation, and deep DeFi lending have all contributed to eye-popping growth, Base‚Äôs support for regional stablecoins and integrations with fiat on/off-ramps have also moved the needle, setting the chain up as a leading arena for stables.
Massive Growth in Stablecoin Transfers
Just last February, Base‚Äôs stablecoin transfer volume sat at about $3.7B. This year, that number had ballooned to $1.9T in February, accounting for 43% of all stablecoin transfers ‚Äî putting Base ahead of Ethereum, Tron, and Solana, for the month.
‚Ä¢ Base now commonly outpaces Ethereum, Tron, and Solana in stablecoin transfer volume.
‚Ä¢ A big factor is the constant flow of Farming MEV, where traders rely on Base‚Äôs speed and liquidity to run their arbitrage and flash-loan strategies, according to
@Dune
and
@artemis
's recent report.
Beyond that, top-notch lending platforms and a wave of memecoins have added fuel to the fire. DeFi giants like Aave and Aerodrome anchor enormous pools of stablecoin liquidity, while the popular protocols like
@virtuals_io
,
@clankeronbase
, and
@flaunchgg
drive transaction velocity from sheer speculative demand.
Regional Stablecoins Boost Financial Inclusion
Base is also big on non-dollar stablecoins ‚Äî an increasingly important way for people to escape volatile exchange rates or gain easy access to DeFi.
‚Ä¢ EURC (Euro-Backed): Introduced in July 2024, EURC has become the largest regional stablecoin on Base, with a current supply of ~$33M.
‚Ä¢ BRZ (Brazilian Real-pegged) has grown 10x, aided by strong liquidity in Aerodrome pools.
Alongside cNGN (Nigerian Naira-pegged), CADC (Canadian Dollar‚Äìpegged), and more, these local stablecoins let people around the world bypass traditional banks and take advantage of DeFi opportunities on Base. Throw in Coinbase Wallet‚Äôs on/off-ramps and the new Onboard P2P option (for trading small amounts of local currency for crypto quickly), and you‚Äôve got an ecosystem that‚Äôs genuinely trying to bring crypto to everyone.",2025-04-01 20:13:40

A üßµ
Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts.
How DAOs Work
It automates rules and decision-making processes. Members use tokens to vote on proposals and changes. All actions and decisions are recorded on the blockchain.
Role in Governance
Empowering community decision-making. Power is distributed among members and members can propose ideas, improvements, or changes.
Advantages of DAO Governance
Every token holder can participate, promoting diverse perspectives. Open, immutable records enhance accountability.
Real World Impact
Sub: DAOs Shaping the Future of Web3. Projects like MakerDAO, Uniswap utilize DAO governance.
As Web3 evolves, DAOs will play more critical role in shaping decentralized ecosystems.
DAOs fuel innovation by sharing decision making in protocols.
How DAOs Could Work in Traditional Elections:
Blockchain-Based Voting ‚Äì Voter identities and votes can be recorded on a transparent and immutable ledger, reducing fraud.
Smart Contracts for Vote Counting ‚Äì Automated vote tallying through smart contracts ensures accuracy and eliminates human errors.
Decentralized Governance ‚Äì Every voter can directly participate in governance without relying on a central authority.
Instant Results ‚Äì Results can be processed in real-time, eliminating long counting periods and reducing election disputes.
Tamper Proof System ‚Äì Once votes are recorded, they cannot be altered, ensuring election integrity.
Pros of DAO-Based Voting Systems:
‚úÖTransparency
‚úÖSecurity
‚úÖEfficiency
‚úÖGlobal Accessibility
Cons of DAO-Based Voting Systems:
üëâScalability Issues.
üëâCybersecurity Risks: While blockchain is secure, potential hacking threats exist in digital identity verification.
üëâDigital Divide: Not everyone has access to Web3 tools, limiting participation.
üëâSmart Contract Vulnerabilities: Bugs in code could be exploited, causing system failures.
While DAOs offer a promising alternative to traditional voting systems, their current development stage presents challenges in scalability, security, and accessibility.
For DAOs to replace conventional voting, further advancements in blockchain technology and regulatory frameworks is necessary.

Here‚Äôs how to ensure every tx you approve is exactly what you expect.
A must-read for DAO & treasury managers, as well as security folks
üßµüëá
Step 1: Get the right tool
Download safe-tx-hashes from the repo
  t.co/PihwayK4XS
This lets you verify Safe transactions BEFORE you sign.
Don‚Äôt trust, verify.
Step 2: Understand your security assumptions
We're assuming:
‚úÖ Foundry is safe
‚úÖ Bash & Perl are safe
‚úÖ The Safe Transaction API is mostly safe (more on this later)
‚úÖ The safe-tx-hashes tool itself is safe
Step 3: Checking a real transaction
Let‚Äôs say your team needs to approve the Uniswap router to access your USDC.
Your Safe UI might show a tx like this‚Ä¶
Click ""Sign,"" and your hardware wallet will show a message. But‚Ä¶ what are you actually signing?
Step 4: The magic of EIP-712
The message you sign is an EIP-712 hash:
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0x19), bytes1(0x01), bytes32($domain_hash), bytes32($message_hash)))
This ensures that ONLY this specific tx on this wallet instance gets signed.
If any detail changes, the hash will be different.
Step 5: Recreate the expected hash
You can do this using Foundry/Bash:
safe_hashes --address <MULTI_SIG_WALLET_ADDRESS> --nonce XX --network XXXX --untrusted
This fetches the tx data & expected signature.
If what you see doesn‚Äôt match what‚Äôs in your wallet ‚Äî üö® STOP!
Step 6: What if the Safe API is compromised?
If an attacker takes over the Safe UI/API, they could push a fake tx.
But your local tool recalculates the expected hash. If there‚Äôs a mismatch, you reject the tx.
Always verify:
‚úÖ Transaction data
‚úÖ Method name (e.g., approve)
‚úÖ Parameters (who gets approved, how much, etc.)
Step 7: Going offline for extra security
Even if the Safe API is compromised, you can verify manually:
safe_hashes --offline --data <TX_DATA> --address <SAFE_ADDRESS> --network XXXX --nonce XX --to <RECIPIENT>
Double-check everything before signing.
Multisigs protect your funds, but only if you verify transactions before signing.
The safe-tx-hashes tool makes this easy.
Stay SAFU.

Investing $1,000 in MANTRA (OM) or Uniswap (UNI) today could yield varying returns by 2030, based on current price predictions.

Changelly: Forecasts OM to reach an average price of $5.26, with potential highs of $6.14.

BitcoinWisdom: Predicts OM could reach between $40.23 and $43.59 by 2031.

First time hearing about Saga? Well, it‚Äôs a L1 blockchain built for developers and businesses to launch their own custom blockchains, making dApps in gaming, AI, and DeFi more scalable and accessible.
We know that most blockchains revolve around gas fees. Saga‚Äôs LIL changes that by making liquidity the foundation, ensuring deeper pools, better incentives, and seamless cross-chain flow. 
This means launching DeFi projects, memecoins, and other on-chain apps just got a whole lot easier.
What makes LIL different?
üîπ Liquidity-first model ‚Äì Prioritizes liquidity incentives over gas fees.
üîπ Cross-chain liquidity ‚Äì Eliminates fragmentation, making multichain DeFi more efficient.

20+ projects are part of the LIL Beta Program, including Metropolis (AI reality arbitrage), LLC (simNGMI), and Crazy Meme.

Based on current analyses and projections, here's an overview of potential outcomes for a $1,000 investment in each, looking ahead to 2030.

Uniswap (UNI):

Current Price: Approximately $6.04 (as of March 2025).

Price Predictions for 2030:

Binance: Projects UNI could reach $7.57 by 2030.

CoinCodex: Estimates UNI's price could be between $1.49 and $4.47 by 2030.

The Currency Analytics: Suggests UNI could reach a high of $158.32 by 2030, with an average price of $98.95.

Potential Investment Value in 2030:

Using Binance's Projection:

If UNI reaches $7.57 by 2030, a $1,000 investment today could grow to approximately $1,264.

Using CoinCodex's Upper Projection:

If UNI attains $4.47 by 2030, the same investment could decrease to approximately $740.

Using The Currency Analytics' Projection:

If UNI reaches $158.32 by 2030, the investment could grow to approximately $26,215.

MANTRA (OM):

Current Price: Approximately $6.35 (as of March 2025).

Price Predictions for 2030:

Changelly: Projects OM could reach between $6.88 and $8.24 by 2030.

Coin Edition: Estimates OM's price could hit $20.25 by 2030.

Traders Union: Predicts OM could reach $12.37 by the end of 2029.

Potential Investment Value in 2030:

Using Changelly's Upper Projection:

If OM reaches $8.24 by 2030, a $1,000 investment today could grow to approximately $1,297.

Using Coin Edition's Projection:

If OM attains $20.25 by 2030, the same investment could grow to approximately $3,188.

Using Traders Union's Projection:

If OM reaches $12.37 by 2029, the investment could grow to approximately $1,947.

Conclusion:

Based on these projections, both Uniswap (UNI) and MANTRA (OM) have the potential for growth by 2030. However, it's essential to recognize that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such forecasts are speculative.

A üßµ
Let‚Äôs dive into how Web3 is reshaping the web with pros, cons & practical examples üëá
Web3 removes middlemen & central authorities. Instead of relying on big tech, it uses blockchain, smart contracts & decentralized storage for transparency & ownership. üìúüîí
Example: Instead of logging into Facebook, you use a wallet like MetaMask to access Web3 apps with no centralized control.
Your Digital Identity
In Web3, you control your data with self-sovereign IDs stored on blockchain. No bans, no data selling.
Example: Ethereum Name Service (ENS) lets you create a decentralized username (e.g., yourname.eth) instead of using emails.
‚ö†Ô∏è Con: If you lose access to your wallet, you lose everything! No Don‚Äôt Forgot Password button here üò¨
‚úÖ Pros: Freedom with DeFi
No more banks freezing funds or slow international transfers or payment. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) allows borderless transactions with instant payments & staking rewards.
Example: Aave & Uniswap let you borrow, lend & trade crypto without needing a bank. No permission required.
‚ö†Ô∏è Con: If you send funds to the wrong address, they‚Äôre gone forever.
‚úÖ Pros: Censorship Resistance
Big tech decides what you can see. Web3 ensures nobody can silence you by storing content across multiple nodes.
Example: Arweave provides decentralized storage where no government can take down your content.
‚ö†Ô∏è Con: Without moderation, harmful content can also exist. How do we balance freedom vs safety?
Privacy & Data Control
‚úÖ Pros:
Web3 uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to verify identity without exposing personal details.
Example: Zcash allows you to make fully private crypto transactions, unlike Bitcoin, which is publicly traceable.
‚ö†Ô∏è Con: Privacy friendly tools can also be used for illicit activities, making regulation tricky.
Challenges of Web3
Adoption
Regulatory Uncertainty
Compliance
Will Web3 Take Over?
Despite challenges, Web3 is growing fast. More real-world apps are being built to fix these issues.
The question is: Are you ready for a decentralized future?

Honestly, it's disappointing to see one of DeFi's pioneers make such a centralized power move.
Uniswap Labs launched their Unichain L2 network with minimal input from the DAO that's supposed to govern it. They've poured $165.5 million into building and incentivizing it, while UNI token holders are left wondering what they're even holding tokens for.
Like - Uniswap has collected around $171 million in front-end fees over two years and hasn't shared any of that with token holders. Meanwhile, Aave and other protocols have figured out how to reward their communities.
It's like opening a restaurant with investors and then keeping all the profits for yourself while telling your investors they should be happy the restaurant exists. LOL.
And then there's the $21 million allocated to grow Unichain's TVL from $8.2 million to $750 million. This isn't bringing new money to the ecosystem - it's just reshuffling existing liquidity from Ethereum and other L2s. For everyday traders, this fragmentation means worse prices and more failed transactions as liquidity thins out across multiple chains.
The community backlash makes perfect sense. When you help build something revolutionary like Uniswap did for DeFi, you create certain expectations. This top-down approach feels like a betrayal of those ideals, and the market seems to agree - look at UNI.
This isn't just a Uniswap problem - it's a warning for all of DeFi. If we're just recreating the same power dynamics of traditional finance with different players, what's the point?

356156957,Unknown,2025-03-12 22:46:45,1741819605108.0,"Why mises browser is the best browser for web3 users on mobileÔºü
Mises Browser has become the best browser for Web3 users on mobile devices because it offers significant advantages in key areas, addressing the specific needs of Web3 users. We believe the primary reasons stem from the following aspects.
Filling the Functional Gap in Mobile Web3 Browsing
Limitations of Traditional Browsers: Traditional mobile browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari) do not natively support Web3 protocols (such as blockchain wallet integration, DApp interaction, or decentralized domain resolution). Users typically rely on third-party apps (e.g., MetaMask mobile) or manual configurations, which are complex and offer a poor experience on mobile.
Mises‚Äô Solution: Mises Browser supports Web3 wallet plug-ins and DApps, enabling users to access the full range of Web3 applications through a single browser without downloading additional wallet apps. It seamlessly brings desktop-level Web3 features (e.g., wallet management, transaction signing) to mobile, lowering the barrier to entry.
Exclusive Support for Browser Extensions
Scarcity of Extensions on Mobile: Most mobile browsers do not support Chrome extensions, yet Web3 users depend on extensions (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect) to connect wallets or manage NFTs, DeFi, and other services.
Mises‚Äô Advantage: Mises Browser is one of the few mobile browsers (available on both iOS and Android) that supports Chrome extensions. This allows users to use familiar tools on their phones without changing habits. For instance, iOS users cannot run MetaMask extensions on Safari, but Mises Browser provides a desktop Chrome-like experience.
Decentralized Domains and Ecosystem Integration
Demand for Web3 Domains: With the growing popularity of decentralized domains like ENS (Ethereum Name Service) and .bit, Web3 users need browsers that can directly resolve these addresses rather than relying on centralized DNS.
Mises‚Äô Support: Mises Browser natively supports multiple Web3 domain systems (e.g., ENS, Unstoppable Domains) and integrates deeply with various blockchain ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum, BSC). This enables users to access DApps or send cryptocurrency using simple domain names, simplifying the process.
Security Optimized for Web3
Web3 Security Challenges: Web3 involves asset management, making phishing sites and malicious DApps common threats. Traditional browsers lack Web3-specific security mechanisms.
Mises‚Äô Protections: Through partnerships with security firms (e.g., SlowMist, GoPlus), Mises Browser implements domain whitelists and real-time detection systems to help users identify trustworthy sites. This Web3-tailored security design is especially critical on mobile, where users are more prone to errors due to screen limitations or misclicks.
Convenience of the DApp Ecosystem
Built-in DApp Store: Mises Browser offers an integrated DApp aggregator supporting over 1,000 mainstream decentralized applications (e.g., Uniswap, OpenSea). Users can access them with a single click, eliminating the need to manually search or input URLs.
Optimized Mobile Experience: Many DApps have poor mobile compatibility. Mises enhances usability through interface optimization and adaptation, addressing Web3 ecosystem shortcomings on mobile.
Alignment with Community and Decentralized Principles
Decentralized Ethos: Mises Browser emphasizes privacy protection and user data sovereignty, aligning closely with Web3‚Äôs decentralized philosophy. Unlike some traditional browsers that rely on ads or data tracking, it focuses on serving blockchain users.
Community Momentum: Mises has gained significant attention through promotion on social media (e.g., X) and within Web3 communities, attracting a large number of crypto enthusiasts. User word-of-mouth and endorsements have further solidified its position.
Relative Weaknesses of Competitors
MetaMask Browser: While MetaMask‚Äôs mobile app includes a powerful built-in browser, it functions more as a wallet with a browser add-on, lacking the extensibility and versatility of Mises.
Brave Browser: Brave supports crypto wallets and privacy but falls short of Mises in DApp aggregation and Web3 domain support.
Opera Crypto Browser: Opera offers Web3 features but lags in extension support and ecosystem integration, with a smaller user base compared to Mises‚Äô penetration in Web3 circles.
Mises Browser does not dominate the global browser market, but it has earned significant recognition within the Web3 user niche, particularly on mobile. According to public data, Mises Browser has exceeded 5 million downloads and is widely recommended in Web3 communities. Its discussion on X and positive user feedback further indicate that it has become the preferred mobile tool for many Web3 users.
Limitations and Balanced Perspective
That said, Mises Browser is not without competition or flaws:
User Scale: Compared to Chrome or Safari, its user base remains small, concentrated among Web3 enthusiasts.
Ecosystem Dependency: Its strengths depend on Web3‚Äôs widespread adoption; if Web3 growth slows, its appeal may diminish.
Learning Curve: For non-crypto users, Mises‚Äô features might feel complex.
Mises Browser has become the primary browser for Web3 users on mobile because it provides innovative solutions to Web3 pain points (e.g., extension support, security, DApp access), surpassing most competitors in functionality and user experience. While it‚Äôs not the ""only choice,"" it stands out in the niche market of mobile Web3 browsing with its comprehensive advantages, making it especially suitable for users deeply engaged in the blockchain ecosystem.

plunges to 8-month low as traders offload holdings

Uniswap ( $UNI ) price trades in the red on Wednesday at $5.84 after falling nearly 9% in the last two days. This downward trend is further supported by UNI‚Äôs Exchange Flow balance, which shows a positive spike.

üí∏ Moreover, Lookonchain data shows that on Wednesday, whale wallet deposited 2.25 UNI tokens worth $13.71 million into the Kraken exchange, likely to cut losses.

What‚Äôs next? A full DeFi stack built for infinite scalability. üßµüëá
First, trading expands.
Right now, we‚Äôve launched with key liquidity pairs:
‚úÖ SAGA / USDC
‚úÖ ETH / USDC
‚úÖ SAGA / ETH
‚úÖ USDC / USDT
‚úÖ SAGA / UNI
But more assets will be added. Think wrapped BTC, stablecoin pools, cross-chain assets, and more.
Next up: Cross-chain liquidity.
Saga‚Äôs LIL isn‚Äôt an isolated DEX, it‚Äôs the foundation for deeper liquidity flows across multiple ecosystems.
Cross-chain swaps & bridges are next in line, making it easier to move assets across L1s, L2s, and appchains.
Perpetual trading is coming.
Saga‚Äôs LIL will support on-chain perps, giving users deep, sustainable liquidity for leverage trading without relying on centralized exchanges.
Think CEX-level performance, but fully on-chain and decentralized.
Then, we expand the DeFi stack.
üî• Lending & borrowing protocols will integrate next, letting users stake SAGA or LP tokens as collateral.
üî• Staking derivatives & LSDs will allow new ways to earn yield.
üî• Automated vaults will enable passive LP strategies.
This isn‚Äôt a single DEX, it‚Äôs an entire economic engine.
And finally: Chainlet-native DeFi.
With the LIL as a liquidity hub, appchains launching on Saga will be able to natively integrate DeFi into their ecosystems.
That means game-native DEXs, AI agent liquidity networks, on-chain derivatives‚Äîall backed by a shared liquidity base.
TL;DR: This launch is just the beginning.
‚úÖ Trading is live
‚úÖ LP incentives are rolling
‚úÖ More assets & cross-chain swaps coming
‚úÖ Perp trading, lending, staking derivatives next
‚úÖ Long-term: Appchain-native liquidity models

The cryptocurrency market remains surprisingly stable, showing minimal volatility over the past 24 hours with several prominent digital assets holding their ground. Bitcoin ($BTC) is currently trading around $86,000, marking a slight 0.4% dip from yesterday.
There‚Äôs speculation about whether this calm is a prelude to significant shifts. Over the past week, $BTC has fluctuated between $78,000 and $95,000, primarily influenced by external factors like the recent trade tensions initiated by US leadership and the announcement surrounding a strategic $BTC reserve in the United States.
On March 7, a noteworthy crypto summit took place at the White House, with crypto leaders and relevant authorities in attendance. During the summit, a commitment was made to create a reserve, with assurances that the government would adopt a ‚Äúnever sell your $BTC‚Äù strategy.
While many anticipated heightened volatility post-summit, the aftermath was relatively subdued. $BTC experienced a drop below $85,500 before stabilizing around $86,000. Market sentiment suggested a potential ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù scenario since the announcement offered minimal direct benefits to investors. Currently, $BTC has been bouncing between $85,700 and $86,500, landing at the $86,000 mark.
As we approach the business week, traders remain on alert for the upcoming US CPI data release on March 12. Historically, these reports tend to stir volatility, affecting market direction. With a market cap sitting at approximately $1.7 trillion, $BTC continues to dominate the altcoin landscape with a 58.2% dominance.
In the altcoin arena, Ethereum ($ETH), Solana ($SOL), Avalanche ($AVAX), and Uniswap ($UNI) have seen slight upticks in the last 24 hours. Conversely, assets like Ripple ($XRP), Binance Coin ($BNB), Cardano ($ADA), Dogecoin ($DOGE), and even Shiba Inu ($SHIB) are grappling with minor declines. Notably, Pi Network ($PI) faces a more significant setback, dropping by 12% and trading around $1.57, a considerable dip from its recent highs.
The total cryptocurrency market cap now stands at approximately $2.92 trillion, reflecting a 1.8% decline in the past day.

project has a liquidity pool. Whether a project uses one depends on its goals, use case, and ecosystem design.
Let‚Äôs break it down so you can understand why some projects rely on them and others don‚Äôt.
#VolumintThread
#DeFi
üí°What is a Liquidity Pool?
A liquidity pool is a smart contract-based reserve of funds (usually two tokens) that allows users to trade without relying on traditional order books. Common in DEXs like Uniswap or PancakeSwap.
#LiquidityPools
#DEX
Projects That Typically Use Liquidity Pools:
‚úÖ Most
#DeFi
projects rely on pools to function. Think Uniswap for swaps, Aave for loans, etc.
‚úÖ New tokens often create pools to ensure their tokens are tradable.
‚úÖ
#Stablecoins
or asset-backed tokens use pools to stabilize prices.
Why
#LiquidityPools
Matter:
‚úîÔ∏è Ensure liquidity for traders (less slippage).
‚úîÔ∏è Incentivize participation via rewards (fees, yield farming).
‚úîÔ∏è Help new tokens gain traction.
But poorly managed pools can lead to issues like impermanent loss or low liquidity.‚ö†Ô∏è
#Volumint
Not all crypto projects need liquidity pools. Their necessity depends on whether the project is decentralized, how users interact with its tokens, and its overall goals.

Uniswap is a protocol that simplifies the market-making and exchange of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Recently, Uniswap Labs announced the launch of the main Unichain network. Unichain is a fast, decentralized L2 Superchain, it will reduce transaction costs by about 95% compared to Ethereum L1 in the short term, and it also introduces a local fiat conversion feature that allows users to transfer their crypto assets to their bank accounts (integration with MoonPay, Robinhood and Transak). On February 25, the SEC completed an investigation into the company. The regulator has no plans to press charges. All these developments form the fundamental basis of UNI's medium-term growth.
If you look at the wallet addresses of the holders, you will see that 82% hold the asset for more than 1 year, while less than 1 month is held by only 2.3% (traders), addresses with balances from $0-1000 make up 92.17%, more than 1000 - 7.56%, the rest is held by whales.

This dominance is driven by three differentiators üëá
Velodrome wins via:
1. Innovative Technology - Slipstream, Superlane
2. Durable Economics - Solves the DEX Trillema
3. Clear Vision - No token sales, no VC unlocks
Let‚Äôs break those down üëá
1. Innovative tech: Slipstream
Thanks to wider tick spacing + increased efficiency, consistency, and flexibility ‚Äî Slipstream wins wherever it competes.
Head to head, it beats Uni V3 77% - 23%
And Slipstream V2 is poised to only deepen this advantage.
  twitter.com/148492269465106023...
1b. Innovative tech: Superlane Interoperability
While other DEXs wait for native interoperability, we helped build it.
With
@hyperlane
, we launched Superchain 1.0, bringing interop to partner chains early.
This unlocked cross-chain emissions & voting, ahead of schedule.
2. Durable economics: MetaDEX
Velodrome uses sustainable token emissions and vote-lock governance to solve the ""DEX trilemma,"" aligning the interests of LPs, traders, and lockers.
Maintaining deep liquidity and efficient swaps across market conditions.
  twitter.com/148492269465106023...
3. Clear vision: A clean launch
Velodrome was built right from the beginning:
$0 VC funding ‚Üí No rent-seeking
No insider token sales ‚Üí Community-owned
Onchain governance ‚Üí Users direct emissions
And, as a MetaDEX, 100% of revenue is distributed each week to veVELO voters.
3b. Clear vision: A public good
Velodrome is a DEX, not its own L2. This means it is in service of the ecosystem, not in competition with its members:
- Doesn't compete with L2s for liquidity
- Connects chains, doesn't vamp them
- Metabolizes value back into the ecosystem
The results, by the numbers:
~$78M ‚Äî TVL
~$26B ‚Äî Cumulative Volume
~$67M ‚Äî Lifetime Voting Rewards
10 Successful Deployments
The top DEX across the Superchain
Launching on Unichain is yet another step in our journey to unify liquidity and connect all chains on the Superchain.
Upcoming features, like Superswaps ‚Äî unlocking frictionless, cross-chain token access ‚Äî will take this vision even further.
Keep building. Stay Optimistic üö¥",2025-04-01 20:38:01

Commune Core
This repo has all the essential modules needed for the protocol:
- Server
- Client
- Key
These core modules are the backbone of Commune, allowing you to easily export any class as an RPC server without extra boilerplate code.
By default, each module exposes the `forward` and `info` functions, but you can customize this with `expose=[your_functions]`. Each function call costs 1 token by default, but you can set custom costs using `fn2cost={fn:cost}`.
App Launch
Our app, which will showcase all registered modules, is dropping this Friday!.
Upcoming Chain Upgrades
Upgrade A:
- Simplifies existing code for better performance.
- Lowers registration costs for modules and subnets.
- No more recurring fees‚Äîregister once and you're good!
Upgrade B:
- Adds staking tokens with different economic models: Stable (1:1), Uniswap v2 (xy=k), bonding curve (pump-fun), and custom curves.
- Liquidity locked for 48 hours after module registration to protect against malicious activity.
- Challenges for slashing require staking tokens equal to the proposed slash amount. A randomized selection of 3 validators (weighted by stake) makes the call‚Äî2/3 consensus needed.

Grevm proved that Ethereum-like transaction parallelization is possible. This upgrade takes it further, hitting 16.57 gigagas/s for Uniswap workloads, matching Block-STM in low-contention cases. It‚Äôs 20‚Äì30% faster with 95% lower CPU usage in non-parallel scenarios.
Lower gas fees, faster execution, greater scalability.
Grevm 1.0 introduced the fastest open-source parallel EVM, but high-contention transactions remained challenging, leading to excessive re-executions. Grevm 2.0 solves this with:
- Optimizing execution order dynamically with DAGs
- Grouping dependent transactions to Task groups to reduce re-execution
Boosting throughput 5.5√ó in hybrid workloads, making complex dApps more efficient.
Grevm 2.0‚Äôs Parallel State Store bundles execution results asynchronously, overlapping 30-60ms of post-execution costs within parallel execution:
- Removing unnecessary delays from post-execution work
- Handling miner rewards & self-destruct without extra costs
Solidity contracts now work without performance penalties, making Gravity more scalable.
Grevm 2.0 refines parallel execution beyond Block-STM, reducing transaction conflicts, optimizing scheduling, and improving CPU efficiency, making Gravity‚Äôs execution more predictable, scalable, and cost-effective.

Say goodbye to centralized intermediaries! Reactive Bridge brings decentralized, secure, and scalable cross-chain token transfers to the DeFi and Web3 ecosystem.
Let's learn moreüëá
Cross-Chain Interoperability Is Here
In a multi-chain world, transferring assets between blockchains shouldn‚Äôt be a hassle. Reactive Bridge uses smart contracts and event-driven architecture to make secure cross-chain token transfers possible without relying on intermediaries.
Trust-Minimized, Decentralized Transfers
Traditional bridges depend on centralized validators, introducing risks. Reactive Bridge eliminates this by using reactive smart contracts, making token transfers decentralized, more secure, and scalable for DeFi and dApp ecosystems.
Two-Way Token Bridge üîÑ
It supports bidirectional token transfers. Whether you're moving tokens from Polygon to Ethereum Sepolia, or vice versa, the reactive contract listens for events and triggers token minting on the destination chain.
Simple, Intuitive UI
No technical knowledge needed! The user-friendly interface makes initiating cross-chain transfers as easy as using Uniswap. Enter the token amount and seamlessly initiate the transfer.
Real-Time Updates
Track your token transfer in real-time! The UI updates token balances instantly, keeping you informed about the entire process, from initiation to minting on the destination chain.
Powered by Smart Contracts
The CrossToken and ReactiveBridge contracts are the heart of the system. They monitor events on both chains and automatically mint tokens on the destination chain once the transfer is requested.
Reactive Event Handling
The ReactiveBridge contract reacts to BridgeRequest events on the origin chain, burning tokens there and minting them on the destination chain. It‚Äôs all event-driven for maximum efficiency.
Supports Multiple Chains
We're also not limited to two chains ‚Äî it‚Äôs designed for multi-chain support! Maintaining reverse mappings to enable cross-chain operations between various networks.
Callback Mechanism for Flexibility
Callbacks ensure that the right function is called on the destination chain, based on events from the origin chain. This decouples bridging logic from specific chains, boosting scalability and flexibility.
A Decentralized Future for DeFi
dApps like Reactive Bridge can be a game-changer for decentralized ecosystems. By removing intermediaries and improving interoperability, we can pave the way for a more decentralized and seamless blockchain experience.
We're ready to start exploring the power of Reactive Smart Contracts, let's see how they can unlock the power of multi-chain assets!",2025-04-01 20:41:27

Reason is that the US SEC (Securities & Exchange Commission) has dropped its investigation into Uniswap Labs.

üîπ What's all the hype with Monad?
üîπ Is it too late to get involved?
üîπ I have testnet $MON, now what?
üîπ Will this make me any money?
‚ùìWhat's all the hype with Monad?
Simply put, Monad aims to compete with the likes of Solana and Ethereum.
With $248M raised, a $3B valuation, and investments from Paradigm, this is some of the strongest backing we‚Äôve seen for a Layer 1 in years. This level of funding shows serious industry confidence and suggests that when Monad‚Äôs mainnet launches, it wont be another pointless ghost chain.
From an airdrop perspective, all the signals are there. Historically, testnets with this level of engagement and ecosystem growth have resulted in some of the biggest airdrop opportunities for early users. We‚Äôve seen it time and time again: the users who interact early, trade, mint NFTs, and provide liquidity often receive the largest allocations.
‚ùìIs it too late to get involved?
No! The testnet just launched which makes now the perfect time roll up your sleeves, get your hands dirty, and see what all the fuss is about. You might even earn an airdrop along the way! The beauty of testnets is they use ""paper"" (pretend) money, so there is no cost to you outside of your time. Fortunately, you have this guide to help save you a ton of time as well.
Before we jump in, here's a quick reminder!
As with all things in web3, remember to prioritize your safety and carefully monitor which wallets you're using and how you interact with any dApps. The recent Abstract exploit has been an unfortunate reminder to stay on your toes. Yes, this is testnet, however scammers are creative so never let your guard down! üîí

üë∑ Deploy & Test Smart Contracts
üîπ Go to Monad Developer Portal
üîπ Check the Build Section for documentation
üîπ Join the Monad Dev Discord for resources
üß† Building on testnet is smart because projects that launch early are more likely to receive ecosystem incentives, funding, and airdrops.
üí≠ Final thoughts:
Airdrop farming isn‚Äôt about checking boxes, it‚Äôs about being a real user of the ecosystem. Spend time exploring, experimenting, and engaging on Monad testnet now, and when mainnet launches, you‚Äôll be first in line for potential rewards.
‚ùìWill this make me any money?
Probably. Maybe. The truth is, we never know. But being rewarded for your curiosity, support, and volume is what web3 is all about. All we can do is show up and put in the effort. üíô
