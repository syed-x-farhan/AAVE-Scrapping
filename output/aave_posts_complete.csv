Impressive news in the DeFi space as Scallop, a lending and borrowing protocol on the Sui blockchain, has achieved remarkable revenue of $79,920 within just 24 hours. This achievement places Scallop second only to Aave in the decentralized finance landscape, showcasing its growing influence in the Sui ecosystem and beyond.
Launched in May 2023, Sui has emerged as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, boasting low transaction fees and scalability, which are critical for the rapid growth of its DeFi applications. With a Total Value Locked surpassing $2 billion, Sui stands as a formidable competitor against established giants like $ETH and $SOL.
Scallop is making waves as the first DeFi protocol to receive an official grant from the Sui Foundation, supported by notable industry leaders. The platform has rapidly gained traction, with a Total Value Locked of approximately $130.27 million, marking a significant 34% increase in just one week. This growth reflects user confidence as Scallop continues to expand its offerings and community engagement.
Recent developments include partnerships that enhance its ecosystem, like the listing of the Walrus token and collaboration with Binance Wallet for yield-focused activities. Scallop Lend‚Äôs unique design encourages borrowing activity through a vote-escrow model, allowing users to earn higher rewards for staking its native token, $SCA.
With these advancements, Scallop is well-positioned to remain a significant player in the DeFi lending sector. The strategic partnerships and robust community support underline its potential in shaping the future of digital finance through innovative solutions.

The days of 1000% APYs and ponzinomics are fading. A new era of structured, scalable, and institutional-ready DeFi is here.
Let‚Äôs talk about what‚Äôs changing & what‚Äôs coming next. üßµ
A few years ago, DeFi was the Wild West:
‚ö° High yields (but high risk)
üé≠ Anonymous projects popping up daily
üí∞ Speculation driving insane returns
It was an experiment‚Äîand one that proved people wanted finance without middlemen.
Now, DeFi is evolving into a serious financial system.
üî∫Institutions are integrating DeFi rails (banks testing Aave, Coinbase integrated Uniswap, BlackRock exploring yield strategies).
üî∫Regulatory clarity is improving, allowing deeper adoption.
üî∫Stablecoins & RWAs are bridging DeFi & TradFi.
This is the next phase.
DeFi isn‚Äôt just about speculation anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming the backbone of real finance onchain. Stablecoins, real-world assets, and deeper liquidity are transforming how capital moves on-chain.
The next phase of DeFi is about scalability, efficiency, and integration with the broader financial system.
Avalanche is at the center of this shift.
With deep liquidity, cross-chain efficiency, and scalable DeFi infrastructure, it‚Äôs where institutions, builders, and traders are making the leap.
What‚Äôs coming next will change the game. üëÄ
Over the next few weeks, we‚Äôll break down:
üíµ The Evolution of Money ‚Üí Stablecoins & FX liquidity
üåâ Bridged Assets ‚Üí What they mean for DeFi
üèõÔ∏è RWAs ‚Üí The institutional on-ramp to DeFi
üìà The Future of Trading ‚Üí Perps, AI & structured yield
You won‚Äôt want to miss this. üî•
This isn‚Äôt just another DeFi hype cycle. It‚Äôs the maturation of on-chain finance.
New assets. New liquidity. New opportunities.
The next era of DeFi is about to begin. Are you ready?

has officially integrated Chainlink SVR in a near-unanimous vote to recapture liquidation MEV, starting with an initial set of markets.
As the largest DeFi lending protocol, Aave is establishing a new standard in cryptoeconomics with SVR.
  www.prnewswire.com/news-releas...
üßµ‚¨áÔ∏è
Chainlink Smart Value Recapture (SVR) is a novel oracle solution that enables DeFi apps to recapture the non-toxic MEV derived from their use of Chainlink Price Feeds.
SVR was built in collaboration with
@bgdlabs
, Flashbots, &
@aave
DAO contributors.
üëá
  blog.chain.link/chainlink-smar...
Chainlink SVR is powered by the same DON architecture that secures existing Chainlink Data Feeds & doesn‚Äôt require intermediary smart contracts.
SVR features enhanced redundancy through a ‚ÄúDual Aggregator"" design, which uses non-SVR Chainlink Data Feeds as a fallback.
SVR introduces an additional source of fees for the Aave & Chainlink ecosystems, boosting the economic sustainability of DeFi.
Recaptured OEV fees will be split, starting with an initial 6-month discounted rate of 65% to the Aave ecosystem and 35% to the Chainlink ecosystem.
SVR is the first Chainlink service to be connected to Payment Abstraction.
Payment Abstraction is a cross-chain enabled payment system that enables service fees to be automatically converted into LINK, reducing payment friction in the Chainlink Network.
More info to come.
This is only the beginning.
A future implementation of SVR is planned to feature increased decentralization, enhanced gas efficiency, cross-chain capabilities, and more.

Price surge? Under control. Stable Surge hook is here to introduce dynamic fee changes to the pool in order to defend the peg.

A üßµ
Let‚Äôs dive into how Web3 is reshaping the web with pros, cons & practical examples üëá
Web3 removes middlemen & central authorities. Instead of relying on big tech, it uses blockchain, smart contracts & decentralized storage for transparency & ownership. üìúüîí
Example: Instead of logging into Facebook, you use a wallet like MetaMask to access Web3 apps with no centralized control.
Your Digital Identity
In Web3, you control your data with self-sovereign IDs stored on blockchain. No bans, no data selling.
Example: Ethereum Name Service (ENS) lets you create a decentralized username (e.g., yourname.eth) instead of using emails.
‚ö†Ô∏è Con: If you lose access to your wallet, you lose everything! No Don‚Äôt Forgot Password button here üò¨
‚úÖ Pros: Freedom with DeFi
No more banks freezing funds or slow international transfers or payment. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) allows borderless transactions with instant payments & staking rewards.
Example: Aave & Uniswap let you borrow, lend & trade crypto without needing a bank. No permission required.
‚ö†Ô∏è Con: If you send funds to the wrong address, they‚Äôre gone forever.
‚úÖ Pros: Censorship Resistance
Big tech decides what you can see. Web3 ensures nobody can silence you by storing content across multiple nodes.
Example: Arweave provides decentralized storage where no government can take down your content.
‚ö†Ô∏è Con: Without moderation, harmful content can also exist. How do we balance freedom vs safety?
Privacy & Data Control
‚úÖ Pros:
Web3 uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to verify identity without exposing personal details.
Example: Zcash allows you to make fully private crypto transactions, unlike Bitcoin, which is publicly traceable.
‚ö†Ô∏è Con: Privacy friendly tools can also be used for illicit activities, making regulation tricky.
Challenges of Web3
Adoption
Regulatory Uncertainty
Compliance
Will Web3 Take Over?
Despite challenges, Web3 is growing fast. More real-world apps are being built to fix these issues.
The question is: Are you ready for a decentralized future?
Let's discuss it below! üëáüî•",2025-03-30 20:20:24

Honestly, it's disappointing to see one of DeFi's pioneers make such a centralized power move.
Uniswap Labs launched their Unichain L2 network with minimal input from the DAO that's supposed to govern it. They've poured $165.5 million into building and incentivizing it, while UNI token holders are left wondering what they're even holding tokens for.
Like - Uniswap has collected around $171 million in front-end fees over two years and hasn't shared any of that with token holders. Meanwhile, Aave and other protocols have figured out how to reward their communities.
It's like opening a restaurant with investors and then keeping all the profits for yourself while telling your investors they should be happy the restaurant exists. LOL.
And then there's the $21 million allocated to grow Unichain's TVL from $8.2 million to $750 million. This isn't bringing new money to the ecosystem - it's just reshuffling existing liquidity from Ethereum and other L2s. For everyday traders, this fragmentation means worse prices and more failed transactions as liquidity thins out across multiple chains.
The community backlash makes perfect sense. When you help build something revolutionary like Uniswap did for DeFi, you create certain expectations. This top-down approach feels like a betrayal of those ideals, and the market seems to agree - look at UNI.
This isn't just a Uniswap problem - it's a warning for all of DeFi. If we're just recreating the same power dynamics of traditional finance with different players, what's the point?
True decentralization means communities have real power, not just the illusion of it while founders make all the decisions that matter.",2025-03-30 20:20:25

LTF Analysis:

The $AAVE chart is looking quite interesting at the moment. $AAVE has just completed its CD leg and appears primed for a reversal. On the lower timeframe, $AAVE has been trading within a descending channel and is currently testing the channel's upper boundary.

If $AAVE successfully flips the trendline resistance into support, a long position can be considered, with the first target set around the $195 horizontal resistance level. On the other hand, if $AAVE faces rejection here, a safer long entry could be from the horizontal support level, where the CD leg would fully complete. Keep monitoring $AAVE for potential long opportunities.

The World Liberty Financial Initiative (WLFI), a notable cryptocurrency project backed by US President Donald Trump, has successfully concluded its token sale, raising an impressive $590 million. This achievement puts WLFI among the top 10 largest token raises in history.
WLFI tokens were exclusively sold to accredited investors, meaning they cannot be freely traded or transferred to the public. As of now, there is no announced timeline for when WLFI tokens might be listed on exchanges. Launched in September 2024, the project aims to push decentralized finance (DeFi) forward while supporting US dollar-pegged stablecoins to bolster the USD's global dominance. At its core, WLFI features a DeFi lending platform.
The governance token, WLFI, opened for public sale on October 15, initially aiming to raise $300 million by selling 20 billion tokens at $0.015 each. However, demand was weaker than expected, leading to a revised fundraising goal of $30 million after just 766 million tokens sold, which brought in $11 million.
Interest in WLFI surged after the success of Trump-related meme coins like Official Trump (TRUMP) and Official Melania (MELANIA). By January 20, the initial sale wrapped up with 20% of the total supply sold. In response to increased demand, WLFI introduced an additional 5 billion tokens priced at $0.05 each, which quickly neared sellout by March 13.
WLFI token holders will receive governance rights over the WLF Protocol, although tokens will remain non-transferable for the first year after launch. Notable investor Justin Sun, founder of Tron, made headlines by buying $30 million worth of WLFI tokens in late November, securing his position as the top investor.
Despite the fundraising success, WLFI's portfolio of 9 crypto assets is currently battling a loss of $124 million. Major losses arise from Wrapped Bitcoin ($wBTC), Aave ($AAVE), and Tron ($TRX) amid a turbulent market week. Interestingly, WLFI's holdings are heavily invested in Ethereum ($ETH), accounting for 65% of its portfolio. The company acquired ETH at roughly $3,240 a token, but with prices dropping to around $1,900, this has significantly impacted overall portfolio losses.

- $AAVE is currently in the SDT Accumulation Zone.

Spot:

- If the price holds the $159 - $169 zone, it is likely to move toward $190 - $200 afterward.

Investors took notice, with $AAVE surging 21% in just 24 hours, far outpacing the broader market's modest 3.5% increase. If this proposal passes, it could be like discovering an unexpected treat at a party that you thought was winding down.

TL;DR
- The ‚ÄúAavenomics update‚Äù aims to boost $AAVE token value and user rewards, featuring increased profit sharing and a $1 million weekly buyback program.
- Aave plans to introduce a self-protection system called ‚ÄúUmbrella‚Äù to shield users from market downturns, setting a new standard in user protection.

The ‚ÄúAavenomics update‚Äù is being hailed as a game-changer for Aave. Marc ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù Zeller expressed his excitement on Twitter, inviting community feedback. After five years of hard work, they‚Äôre ready to redefine user interactions on their platform.

One standout feature is the Anti-GHO token, which offers unique options: burn it to erase GHO debt or convert it into staked GHO (StkGHO) for extra rewards. It‚Äôs like having a secret menu item that could save you some cash.

With plans for a $1 million weekly buyback of $AAVE tokens, Aave is not just stabilizing prices but rewarding loyal users. Plus, the ‚ÄúUmbrella‚Äù system promises to protect users from bad debts, making Aave a beacon of safety in the crypto world.

#crypto
project has a liquidity pool. Whether a project uses one depends on its goals, use case, and ecosystem design.
Let‚Äôs break it down so you can understand why some projects rely on them and others don‚Äôt.
#VolumintThread
#DeFi
üí°What is a Liquidity Pool?
A liquidity pool is a smart contract-based reserve of funds (usually two tokens) that allows users to trade without relying on traditional order books. Common in DEXs like Uniswap or PancakeSwap.
#LiquidityPools
#DEX
Projects That Typically Use Liquidity Pools:
‚úÖ Most
#DeFi
projects rely on pools to function. Think Uniswap for swaps, Aave for loans, etc.
‚úÖ New tokens often create pools to ensure their tokens are tradable.
‚úÖ
#Stablecoins
or asset-backed tokens use pools to stabilize prices.
Why
#LiquidityPools
Matter:
‚úîÔ∏è Ensure liquidity for traders (less slippage).
‚úîÔ∏è Incentivize participation via rewards (fees, yield farming).
‚úîÔ∏è Help new tokens gain traction.
But poorly managed pools can lead to issues like impermanent loss or low liquidity.‚ö†Ô∏è
#Volumint
Not all crypto projects need liquidity pools. Their necessity depends on whether the project is decentralized, how users interact with its tokens, and its overall goals.

Multiply your yield streams with USDC lending + $weETH/ $ezETH/ $rsETH staking.
Breakdown below.
1/11
Your returns = USDC lending + 3 different restaking yields - ETH borrowing costs
How?
‚Ä¢ Deposit USDC, earn ~3.81% Aave lending interest
‚Ä¢ Borrow ETH at only ~2.27% against your USDC
‚Ä¢ Convert borrowed ETH to weETH, ezETH, and rsETH ‚Üí earn 3x restaking yields
2/11
Why?
Validators earn additional yield by securing multiple networks with the same ETH.
By using three different restaking tokens (from
@ether_fi
@RenzoProtocol
@KelpDAO
), this strategy captures yields from 3 Ethereum restaking ecosystems.
3/11
So?
Triple the exposure = optimized risk-reward.
‚Ä¢ Diversified exposure across multiple restaking protocols
‚Ä¢ Lower risk from protocol-specific failures
‚Ä¢ Higher yield potential from varied strategies
‚Ä¢ More resilience against token depegging
4/11
The math works in your favor:
1. USDC earns ~3.81% on Aave
2. ETH borrowing costs only ~2.27%
3. weETH, ezETH & rsETH continuously appreciate against ETH
4. Conservative 75% LTV protects against market volatility
Sophisticated yield optimization made simple.

As crypto traders absorb Bitcoin's rebound above $87,000 following the flash meltdown, AAVE climbs roughly 8% on Wednesday.

Despite institutional traders losing interest in risk assets, crypto market value is back over $2.9 trillion.

After Monday's market fall, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP rebound slowly.

The Aave lending protocol's native token, AAVE, is gaining on Wednesday as the crypto market rebounds from Monday's massacre. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP increase slightly as markets remain risk-averse ahead of the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

Trader excitement is low as the crypto world prepares for the inaugural White House Crypto Summit.
  Alternative.io
's crypto dread & Greed Index reads 20 on a scale of 0 to 100, indicating traders' dread.

At the time of writing, AAVE is up about 8%, while BTC, ETH, and XRP are behind.

Why is AAVE rising?

AAVE launched its lending markets on Sonic, a Fantom-based blockchain. The DeFi lending platform's 2025 Layer 1 growth was part of its strategy.

After the governance proposal was approved, AAVE version 3 was launched on Sonic Labs, resulting in a $33 million TVL gain in 24 hours.

Today, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP gain 1.21%, 3.15%, and 1.85%. The placement of XRP to the US Crypto Strategic Reserve prompted worries among X traders, raising arguments about its significance. However, the token is maintaining its over 8% seven-day gains and recovering slowly.

On Wednesday, Ethereum is at $2,100 and Bitcoin is nearing $90,000 barrier.

AAVE's daily chart Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rising and around 50. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicates a bullish crossing, indicating AAVE's price trend is favorable, but smaller than the final week of February.

1. A user lends ETH tokens that are on the Ethereum, BNB Chain and Polygon networks. The ETH tokens are seamlessly deposited onto the Ethereum network
2. Using the deposited ETH as collateral on Ethereum, the user borrows $100k USDC on Base.
3. The user then borrows an additional $10k USDC on Polygon, still using the ETH collateral on Ethereum.

Welcome to today's analysis! Let‚Äôs break down the current price action on $AAVE and what to expect next.

üåê Overview: $AAVE Uptrend & Resistance Test
üìà After a downtrend, $AAVE is now in an uptrend and is approaching the red resistance zone, which is just above the previous lower high (LH).

üîÑ Current Scenario:

$AAVE has already moved above the previous LH, signaling bullish momentum.
The next key step is breaking the red resistance zone to confirm further upside potential.
If the price breaks out, the first target is the blue line level.
üîë Key Levels to Watch
üî¥ Resistance Zone: Red Level (Needs breakout to confirm continued uptrend)
üîµ First Target: Blue Line Level (If breakout succeeds)

üõ†Ô∏è Trade Scenarios
üìå Bullish Scenario (Breakout Above Resistance & Continuation to Blue Target)

If $AAVE breaks and holds above the red resistance zone, it could confirm a bullish continuation, moving toward the blue line target.
üìå Bearish Scenario (Rejection at Resistance & Retest of Support)

If $AAVE gets rejected at the red resistance, price could pull back for a retest before attempting another breakout.
üìå Conclusion
$AAVE is in an uptrend, and a breakout above the red resistance zone would confirm bullish continuation toward the blue target level. If the price gets rejected, a retest of lower support zones may follow before another breakout attempt.

How this strategy works:
- rETH continuously appreciates against ETH (that's how staking rewards accrue)
- When ETH borrow rates are lower than rETH's staking yield = free money
- Plus you're still earning on your original USDC deposit
Your returns = USDC lending + rETH staking - ETH borrowing costs

Possible Risks:
- Market volatility: Sharp ETH price moves can affect your position
- Interest rate fluctuations: ETH borrow rates can increase
- Smart contract risks: We use audited protocols but risk is never zero

One standout feature is the introduction of boosted pools, which automate tasks to optimize yields for liquidity providers. Unlike traditional pools, these allow funds to be moved to external lending markets, generating additional returns without user intervention! üìà
Another innovative addition is hooks, enabling customization of liquidity pool behavior based on specific conditions. For instance, the Stablesurge hook protects stable assets from de-pegging during volatile market conditions, ensuring smooth exchange operations. üîí

- World Liberty Financial, the DeFi protocol connected to the Trump family, transferred over $350 million in Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and other assets on Monday, per Arkham Intelligence.
Key Details:
- Most of the transferred assets came from Ethereum and WBTC, with transfers marked to Coinbase Prime, sparking rumors of possible sales on the platform.
- However, the venture insists this is part of ‚Äúroutine treasury management,‚Äù addressing working capital needs, and clarifies it is not selling tokens but reallocating assets for regular business purposes.
- World Liberty‚Äôs total holdings have dropped significantly from over $400M to around $33M, with smaller assets like Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK) also moved.
- This is the second reassurance from the project that no tokens are being sold. A week after the last announcement on Jan. 14, the firm purchased $100M in crypto assets, including $47M in Ethereum and WBTC.
- Worth noting, World Liberty Financial is closely linked to Donald Trump, who serves as the Chief Crypto Advocate, with his sons involved as ""Web3 Ambassadors.""
- Eric Trump has recently expressed optimism about Ethereum, saying ‚Äúin my opinion, its a great time to add $ETH,‚Äù fueling speculation in the crypto community.

Cryptocurrency Landscape Overview - January 30, 2025
#LitecoinETF
:
Buzz is building around a potential Litecoin ETF following Canary Capital's filing. Litecoin ($LTC) has jumped to $215.45 USD, a 18% increase, with trading volumes at $1.2 billion in the last 24 hours. An ETF could signal a new wave of institutional investment into altcoins, propelling Litecoin into the spotlight alongside Bitcoin.

#Tesla
:
Elon Musk's Tesla is once again at the center of crypto speculation. Beyond Bitcoin, could Tesla's next move involve $ETH or even $DOGE? Musk's influence could redefine market trends, making Tesla's crypto strategy a key watch point for investors.

#MacroInsights
:
The global economic landscape is steering crypto investment strategies. With inflation and central bank policies in flux, stablecoins like $USDT and USDC are seen as safe havens, while DeFi tokens $AAVE and COMP offer yield opportunities in a low-interest environment. This macro-economic shift is reshaping how investors approach crypto.

#FED
:
The Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions are crypto market movers. Low rates could boost investments in riskier assets like $BTC, which might be viewed as digital gold, or DeFi tokens like AAVE and COMP for their yield potential. The FED's next move is eagerly anticipated by the crypto community.

#CMCSmartQuests
:
CoinMarketCap's Smart Quests are not just educational but also spotlight tokens like $ENJ for gaming and $EDU for learning. By engaging users, these quests could drive interest in new or underappreciated tokens, including LINK for its oracle services or $UNI for DeFi trading.",2025-03-30 21:04:49

Once we see a smaller recovery here, we will be looking for further pressure from sellers, so let's see and wait if we get any confirmations on weakening; if not, then we will head to the upper resistance zone!

351954456,Unknown,2025-01-29 08:26:01,1738139161284.0,"üö® You won't believe: World Liberty Financial (WLF), a venture associated with Donald Trump and his family, has been aggressively accumulating cryptocurrencies. The public wallet linked to WLF now holds $370.4 million in assets across 44 different cryptocurrencies.
WLF's accumulation strategies suggest its growing influence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The venture's key holdings include 59,269 ETH (+3,921% since pre-inauguration), 647 WBTC (+3,570%), and 19,399 stETH (+309%). Other significant assets in their portfolio include USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and even meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Mog Coin (MOG).
This wallet's behavior aligns with Donald Trump's pledge to position the U.S. as a leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. The substantial accumulation of cryptocurrencies indicates confidence in future policies and a strong belief in the market's potential.
Last week, an investor added $45 million to World Liberty Financial, bringing their total investment to $75 million, making them the platform's largest investor and advisor. WLF has announced plans to acquire Tron (TRX) tokens for its treasury and recently completed an initial sale of WLFI governance tokens at $0.05 each.
Despite a sluggish start in October, token sales have surged to $300 million, driven by high demand. The project has gained popularity with over 34,000 holders and 44,500 transactions.
Besides WLF, Trump's other crypto ventures, including the Official Trump (TRUMP) and Official Melania (MELANIA) meme coins, have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and their impact on his administration. Trump has a history of licensing his name for various products, from steaks to real estate courses. However, federal laws that prevent executive branch employees from engaging in policies affecting their financial interests do not apply to the president or vice president, and Trump has complied with legal requirements.
Both the meme coins have experienced significant value losses since their peaks. TRUMP lost over 57% in the past nine days, while MELANIA shed nearly 80% during the same period. Additionally, large holders have been found to dominate both ecosystems.

The price action for this asset is currently moving within a corrective channel. At the moment, the asset has approached the support level closely. Whether it will enter it or not is uncertain. For spot investments, this is a decent entry point, while on futures, a more precise entry point may be worth looking for. The initial long target will be the range of 408-425. After that, we‚Äôll need to monitor the buyer‚Äôs behavior.
