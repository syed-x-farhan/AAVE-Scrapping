Before diving into USH’s specific mechanisms, it's helpful to compare it with other decentralized stablecoins like DAI and GHO, which don't include a built-in redemption mechanism. Those stablecoins rely entirely on traders, arbitrageurs, market makers, and minters stepping in when their value dips below $1, believing it will naturally return to its intended value.
While effective on highly liquid blockchains with active markets, this model wouldn’t work well in the current MultiversX environment, where professional and sophisticated participants as well as fundamental component for their activities are still to be built. Without enough arbitrage activity and proactive minters, this soft-peg system alone can't maintain stability. USH addresses this issue by incorporating a redemption mechanism that acts as an extra safeguard, helping to keep its value stable when market dynamics alone are insufficient.
Understanding USH’s Design
Let's now examine why USH was designed this way, the advantages it offers, and its current limitations:
Unlike the stability fee model used by DAI (which adjusts borrowing costs to balance stablecoin supply and demand), USH uses a redemption mechanism. This guarantees that each USH token always maintains a value close to $1, because the protocol guarantees you can always exchange it back for exactly $1 worth of collateral.
The redemption mechanism serves as an automatic safety net or a self-correcting feature if the ecosystem can't balance itself naturally. When there's too much USH circulating and its value falls below $1 (known as a ""depeg""), redemptions encourage reducing the supply, helping restore balance. It's important to note that just issuing stablecoins doesn't automatically create liquidity, and real equilibrium only occurs when the amount issued matches market demand.
Unlike centralized stablecoins, which are directly backed one-for-one with dollars (FIAT), decentralized stablecoins like USH are backed by volatile crypto assets, meaning minting these tokens implies the creation of debt. This introduces a responsibility to maintain sufficient collateral, with liquidation mechanisms in place to prevent any risk of accumulating bad debt or under-collateralization.
This means that positions need to be individualized, as each one has different collateralization parameters and therefore risk.
When debt is created, redemptions could work in two ways:
• Each user sees an equal share of his debt repaid and loses an equivalent part of his collateral. Meaning that redemption is socialized to all participants.
• Specific users are individually targeted.
If redemption were evenly spread among all users, for example, if 0.1% of the total supply was redeemed, and everyone lost exactly 0.1% of their collateral, no user would have the chance to avoid redemption. This would remove the motivation for users to voluntarily rebalance supply and demand, as everyone would be affected equally regardless of their actions.
In this scenario, redemptions would become a shared burden, meaning no single user would feel individually responsible for restoring the stablecoin’s balance, since everyone would bear the cost equally.
This is why USH uses individual redemptions. Specifically targeting users closest to their borrowing limits motivates them to either increase their collateral or repay part of their debt to protect their assets. When users actively manage their positions this way, the whole system stabilizes naturally and relies less on frequent redemptions.
Over time, this approach naturally brings borrowing limits down to a balanced level where stablecoin supply matches demand. As confidence grows in the stablecoin’s stability, redemptions become less frequent, and borrowing limits can safely rise again.
Today, various stablecoin models exist, each emphasizing different priorities:
• Redeeming from users with the highest borrow limits encourages higher overall collateral in the system, limiting recourse to liquidation (used by Liquity V1).
• Redeeming from users with the lowest borrowing rates boosts the protocol’s earnings, allowing it to incentivize future liquidity and demand, especially as total debt grows larger than available supply (used by Liquity V2).
With USH, we've combined elements of both models. Since the collateral used generates staking rewards, this allows us to provide extra incentives for liquidity. Essentially, the better collateralized the entire protocol is, the more rewards can be distributed to users relative to the total circulating supply of USH.
Therefore, we've chosen a 0% borrowing rate with no initial minting fee, and redemptions that target users based on how close they are to their borrowing limits.
Current Challenges
Now that we've covered the theory, let's look at the challenges we've encountered and the solutions currently being considered.
Initially, redemptions weren't very effective due to limited participation, insufficient liquidity, and a general lack of awareness about arbitrage opportunities between sEGLD and EGLD pool on Ashswap. Additionally, high fees related to complex trades made redemptions less profitable.
We had initially designed the redemptions to force a buyback of USH, to ensure that their efficiency had a direct positive impact on the peg. However, while this approach has benefits, it only creates buying pressure during brief moments when redemptions are immediately profitable, rather than providing consistent buying support over longer periods.
Additionally, the original method made users feel that redemptions didn’t directly protect the dollar value of their positions because they couldn't redeem USH directly and instead, they had to swap it for EGLD to regain their original exposure.
The first solution was creating a simple, user-friendly redemption interface that anyone could use without technical expertise. Unlike automated redemption bots, regular users often just want to acquire collateral (sEGLD) at a lower price rather than complete complex arbitrage strategies. Because of this, regular users have a lower threshold for profitability, making redemptions attractive even under less favorable conditions.
Similarly, users who want to liquid-stake their EGLD tokens are now automatically directed to AshSwap if that allows them to get more sEGLD.
These improvements have significantly boosted redemption reliability and efficiency in maintaining USH’s peg. Additionally, they allow everyday users and not just automated bots to benefit from these opportunities.
However, a key challenge remains: redemption currently occurs too frequently. While the peg is strong, the rapid supply turnover means users must actively monitor and manage their positions if they wish to maintain consistent exposure to EGLD. This high frequency is partly due to limited efficient market-making activities, which means EGLD's price fluctuations have a strong impact, both positive and negative on USH’s peg.
When the price of EGLD rises, it usually happens first on centralized exchanges (CEXs), as they have higher trading volumes and more liquidity. This initially creates a price difference, making EGLD temporarily cheaper on MultiversX. Traders notice this and move USDC onto MultiversX, buy EGLD at a lower price, and sell it on centralized exchanges for a profit. This arbitrage activity quickly brings prices back into alignment .
A similar process occurs with USH. When EGLD’s price goes up externally, the EGLD<>USH liquidity pool on MultiversX needs more USH tokens to match this new price. As a result, more USDC ends up accumulating in the USH<>USDC pool, strengthening and stabilizing USH’s peg.
Conversely, when EGLD’s price drops significantly, the EGLD price in the EGLD<>USH liquidity pool can differ substantially from the real EGLD price (the oracle price in USD). If this price difference becomes large enough to cross a predefined redemption threshold, users have a financial incentive to buy USH and redeem it for collateral. This redemption activity helps push USH’s price back up towards $1, effectively acting as a ""market maker of last resort"" as a backup mechanism that kicks in whenever normal market activities aren’t enough to manage EGLD’s volatility and protect USH’s peg.
One of the core ideas behind this system was to position USH not only as a pathway to USDC liquidity but as a driving force within the ecosystem itself, one that doesn't depend solely on centralized stablecoins for growth. Redemptions are extremely important, as they help keep USH’s circulating supply balanced, aligned with what the ecosystem can sustainably support while leaving room for natural, organic growth based on the overall strength of the ecosystem.
The Path Moving Forward
To address these issues, we're currently exploring several potential improvements:
1. Direct USH Redemption with Small Fee
First, we're considering allowing direct redemption of USH tokens, charging only a small redemption fee. This would encourage users to buy USH anytime its value falls below $1 and not just when immediate profit opportunities appear through the current redemption process. Users would have the assurance that they'll always get back at least 99.5% of their dollar value (assuming a small 0.5% fee). This approach would also help recently redeemed users regain their collateral directly, avoiding the extra step of swapping tokens. Additionally, this could address extreme situations where there isn't enough liquidity available to buy back collateral efficiently, preventing larger losses.
This new redemption option would complement the current model. The existing redemption strategy would remain active but with a lower trigger threshold, such as around $0.98. In this way, the current model becomes purely a safety net rather than the primary method for controlling the peg.
2. Dynamic Minting Fees During Depeg
Next, we're looking into adding a dynamic upfront minting fee whenever USH's price falls below $1 (a depeg). Currently, there's no direct discouragement for minting USH during a depeg, potentially adding unnecessary selling pressure exactly when USH supply needs to decrease. Right now, someone minting USH at $0.99 doesn't immediately experience a loss unless USH rises again above this price. Introducing a fee tied to the level of the depeg would create a stronger incentive to avoid minting when USH is below its target, thus stabilizing the supply more quickly and efficiently.
3. Separate Redemption Prioritization for Liquidity Providers
Finally, we're evaluating a new way to prioritize redemptions. Right now, many users mint USH to participate in liquidity pools to earn incentives, but frequent redemptions make this strategy unpredictable. One idea is creating a separate ""Isolated Pool"" specifically for liquidity providers. This would allow redemption priority to differ based on user behaviour.
This setup would result in two separate redemption lists. Regular borrowers (those creating leveraged or long positions, for example) often affect USH’s stability significantly, while liquidity providers help support the overall stability of the system. Redemptions would continue to occur in order of borrowing limits (highest to lowest), but liquidity providers would only face redemption after all regular borrowers have been redeemed first.
We still need to carefully study the implications of this change. It's important to note that for users uncomfortable with the redemption mechanism, simply buying USH directly from secondary markets to build liquidity positions might be a healthier alternative. Doing so adds helpful buying pressure when USH is below $1 and offers extra profit opportunities as USH returns to its intended value.
Our immediate next step is determining the benefits that this new ranking mechanism could bring, when clarifying the incentive not necessarily to mint USH to participate in the Liquidity Provision might be sufficient and avoid adding further complexity.
Partners who participated in providing the initial liquidity for USH will be able to migrate their positions into a second Isolated Protocol starting next week. This will allow them to maintain their positions without being subject to redemptions while we finalize the development of the upcoming feature. As key contributors to USH's stability, their participation is essential, and this measure will ensure they can continue supporting the ecosystem without disruption.
In addition to these first 3 pillars, we are also considering research into facilitating market making by our own means by having working capital in EGLD, USDC, and USH, capable of responding to a certain volatility while remaining at least dollar-value neutral. In any case, if you have the necessary knowledge and would like to participate on your own in this kind of activity, don't hesitate to contact us on the Hatom Dev Telegram, we'll be delighted to help you :

CEX lost profits due to Hyperliquid capturing market share and they tried to nuke it.
🧵 Here's how it happened. A long post.
This is the second time Hyperliquid was attacked, this time with the JellyJelly token.
If you want to read more on the first attack, see my first reply to this post and hit a follow
@DU09BTC
.
While the attack method was similar to the first, this time, CEXes joined in to maximize damage.
The attacker used a low market cap token, JellyJelly with $20 mil mcap, to manipulate its price and incur bad debt to HLP, the vault that provides liquidity for trades on Hyperliquid. More on the attacker later.
At first, the attacker opened a leverage short on Jelly and crashed the price off-chain. This pushed the position in profit.
However, soon after, the token was pumped 500% within 1h.
The Jelly short position immediately incurred bad debt which could not be liquidated on time without major losses for the HLP vault (and its users!).
We will get back to this later because it's the main point.
HLP engine took over the position and held an un-realized loss of over $10 million.
As the price pumped, the loss increased. If the Jelly price went high enough, all HLP vault money (or user money) would have been wiped out at around $300 mil.
🚨 What made it worst?
Binance, OKx, and Bybit decided to list Jelly futures just as this attack was happening.
Let's pause here and explain this in more detail:
1. Tier 1 exchanges like the ones above NEVER really list a $20 mil mcap token
2. Exchanges always start with spot listings, and if there is sufficient volume/mcap, they may add futures next
3. Future listings require a lot of liquidity/market cap to prevent price manipulations
In this case, all of this was ignored and Jelly was listed directly on futures, with no spot markets, as Hyperliquid was being attacked.
Why?
To make things worse for Hyperliquid. There is no other reason.
Such Tier 1 exchanges never really add futures for 20 mil mcap tokens because it's bad practice (due to risks of manipulations), but this time was different.
Hyperliquid was involved.
Worse, @zxachxbt showed that the wallets manipulating Jelly on Hyperliquid were funded from... Binance!
Suddenly, this does not look like a lone trader trying to make some profit. It seems much more than that.
🚨 What did Hyperliquid team do?
They delisted Jelly. However, when they did that, they also did something questionable, but necessary to protect users.
The Jelly short was originally opened at $0.011 and the price was around $0.038 when the call was made to cut Jelly out.
The position had a negative PNL of $10 mil which would have been paid by users in the HLP vault.
However, the team literally changed the price of Jelly on their ""DEX"" to $0.0095 before closing the short position.
This meant that the trade was settled $700k in PROFIT for HLP users!
🔥 WHAT?!
What used to be a $10 mil loss turned into $700k profit by changing the price manually, and ignoring the ongoing market price.
This raised eyebrows because this was supposed to be a ""decentralized"" exchange, but Hyperliquid team was determined to protect their users, and they delivered there after a vote from validators.
However, the damage was done.
The HLP vault, which acts as a liquidity layer for Hyperliquid and counterparty to traders, saw over $100 mil in liquidity being withdrawn by users pulling out their money.
Since the first attack, HLP vault went from $500 mil in liquidity to under $200 mil today.
The lower this figure gets, the less liquidity for traders, higher slippage, and generally worse experience for any big whales keen to trade on this exchange.
That's exactly what competing CEXes want. To kill Hyperliquid so users go back to them.
Hour after this happened, the Bitget CEO posted on X that Hyperliquid is FTX 2.0, accusing them of being unethical and exposed users to systemic risk.
Some time ago, Jeff (the Hyperliquid lead) accused Bitget of manipulating users trading flows to their advantage, essentially Biget was trading against their users.
However, Binance, OKx, and Bybit pilling on Hyperliquid when they needed to be supported was surprising.
🚨 Who was behind this?
On-chain data shows that Wintermute is the market maker for Jelly. They are also active on Hyperliquid since 2024.
Wintermute is one of the biggest market makers in crypto with close ties to... Binance.
There is no clear proof they may be involved in this directly, but it's obvious Hyperliquid touched a sensitive spot with their success and CEXes hate it.
🚨 Where next?
The actions of Hyperliquid team and validators to protect users and HLP was the best outcome at the expense of decentralization.
This will change many things, but Hyperliquid is the best shot we got at a decentralized exchange.
This was a clear attack. The honeymoon period for Hyperliquid is over. They are now in PvP mode with other big players hunting their HLP vault.

• The Most Published News
MicroStrategy made headlines with its aggressive $584 million Bitcoin purchase—pushing its holdings past 500,000 BTC—which has intensified debates about high-leverage acquisitions in volatile market conditions. Circle’s regulated USDC launch in Japan, executed through its SBI partnership, marks a significant milestone for digital finance adoption in the region. Ripple’s CEO also grabbed attention by announcing a strategic shift toward U.S. markets for payments and securities following the easing of its longstanding SEC legal pressures.
• Current Market Trends
Kraken is reportedly exploring a debt raise of up to $1 billion ahead of a potential IPO, reflecting the exchange’s ambitions and robust trading figures of $665 billion in cumulative volume. Meanwhile, Monday’s sustained positive ETF inflows—with significant investments led by FBTC—underscore renewed investor confidence. BNB Chain’s $100 million liquidity program, targeting native projects on major centralized exchanges, further illustrates ongoing efforts to bolster network activity and market liquidity.
• Regulations and Policies
President Trump’s upcoming announcement on reciprocal tariffs to cut the U.S. trade deficit is poised to impact the crypto market, potentially stirring volatility depending on the aggressiveness of the measures. Coinbase lobbyists are also pushing Congress to enact combined market structure and stablecoin legislation aimed at clarifying regulatory oversight, reporting, and audit requirements. In a related development, the FDIC has eliminated its reputational risk factor from bank supervision guidelines—a change that pre-empts crypto debanking concerns and signals a more favorable regulatory environment.
• Technology and Innovation
Berachain has kicked off a new era on its EVM-based Layer-1 blockchain by launching its innovative Proof-of-Liquidity system and advancing to Governance Phase 1, a move designed to enhance ecosystem liquidity and decentralization. Ethereum is gearing up for major upgrades in 2025—dubbed Pectra and Fusaka—that promise to improve staking efficiency, expand data capacity for rollups, and streamline smart contract operation. In another breakthrough, Custodia Bank and Vantage Bank have successfully tokenized U.S. dollar demand deposits on the Ethereum mainnet, marking a significant integration of blockchain tech within traditional finance.
• Institutional Investor News
Amid ongoing market shifts, Kraken’s potential IPO and planned $1B debt raise highlight the increasing appetite for structured growth within institutional channels. BlackRock has expanded its crypto reach by launching its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, on Solana—a move that underscores the firm’s broader strategy to offer yield-generating, regulated crypto products. Meanwhile, NYDIG’s acquisition of Crusoe’s Bitcoin mining operations, which includes 270 megawatts of natural gas-powered mining assets, represents a strategic consolidation designed to improve energy efficiency and bolster network security.
• Market Forecasts and Expert Opinions
Analysts from QCP Capital note that the recent U.S. stock sell-off appears to be behind us, with historical trends suggesting that April could be a strong month for both equities and Bitcoin. Optimism is further fueled by expectations that a possible Federal Reserve shift toward quantitative easing will inject much-needed liquidity into the market—a nod to Bitcoin’s explosive gains during previous easing cycles. Adding to this bullish sentiment, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has predicted that Bitcoin could soar to as high as $700,000 by 2025 if institutional adoption accelerates.
• Security and Hacking News
In a notable move to restore market integrity, Movement Network has initiated a $38 million buyback program using funds recovered from a rogue market maker responsible for irregular MOVE token trades—a decision complemented by Binance’s decisive action in permanently banning the offending party. Additionally, blockchain analytics revealed a sudden transfer of 10,608 bitcoins (valued at approximately $927 million) from a Mt. Gox address, a large-scale movement that could signal shifting sentiments or potential liquidity events in the market.

[The Most Published News]
Trump-linked World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has invested $3 million in 3.54 million MNT tokens despite its overall crypto portfolio suffering a loss of about $111 million. In related news, analysts now see upside for XRP following the SEC dropping its longstanding lawsuit against Ripple Labs, forecasting that the token could reach $10 by 2030. Meanwhile, decentralized exchange dYdX’s announcement of a token buyback using 25% of its monthly net revenue has captured significant attention as it signals confidence in reinforcing its ecosystem.
[Current Market Trends]
PancakeSwap led decentralized exchange activity this week with a 41.93% jump in trading volume—totaling $14.1 billion—while Uniswap and Raydium recorded notable declines. Additionally, crypto investment products saw a turnaround after five consecutive weeks of outflows, with inflows amounting to $644 million and spot Bitcoin ETFs reporting robust capital inflows, hinting at a cautiously optimistic sentiment among retail and institutional investors.
[Regulations and Policies]
In a dramatic regulatory development, the SEC’s decision to drop its lawsuit against Ripple Labs has clarified the outlook for XRP and broader crypto initiatives. Complementing this, a U.S. Senator has proposed a bold plan to eliminate the Federal Reserve, while the Trump administration moves forward with plans to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Further stirring the debate, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer criticized the U.S. Treasury’s handling of the Tornado Cash lawsuit, spotlighting ongoing challenges in the regulatory landscape.
[Technology and Innovation]
Dubai-based DWF Labs has launched a $250 million fund aimed at mid- to large-cap blockchain projects, with an emphasis on overcoming onboarding hurdles and strengthening infrastructure for mainstream crypto adoption. In another innovation push, Ethereum is set to roll out two major upgrades, Pectra and Fusaka, expected to enhance staking efficiency, scalability, and smart contract functionality. Meanwhile, Circle is gearing up to launch its USDC stablecoin in Japan through a partnership with SBI Holdings, marking the first regulated stablecoin introduction in the country.
[Institutional Investor News]
Institutional confidence in crypto is underscored by significant moves in Bitcoin accumulation. Michael Saylor’s Strategy recently acquired 6,911 BTC—boosting its total holdings to over 506,000 BTC—while MicroStrategy made a sizeable $584 million Bitcoin purchase to further expand its digital asset portfolio. BlackRock has also deepened its crypto reach by expanding its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to the Solana blockchain, reflecting the growing appetite among institutional investors for yield-generating, blockchain-based products.
[Market Forecasts and Expert Opinions]
Market analysts remain bullish on long-term ratings despite short-term volatility. With the SEC lawsuit behind it, XRP is projected to hit $10 by 2030, a forecast supported by potential uplifts from the adoption of Ripple’s own stablecoin and prospects for an IPO. In addition, QCP Capital highlights historical trends showing that April and Q2 typically favor both risk assets and Bitcoin, suggesting that the current market environment could see renewed positive momentum if macro factors stabilize.
[Security and Hacking News]
Security challenges persist in the crypto space. Dohrnii Labs has filed a police report in the UAE against Blynex, accusing the exchange of unauthorized liquidation of its DHN tokens amid a broader backdrop of market turbulence. In a related development, Movement Network has announced it will use recovered funds—amounting to $38 million from a rogue market maker misconduct case—to execute a token buyback program aimed at restoring market stability and investor confidence.
[Conclusion]
Today’s broad array of crypto news underlines a market in transition. While regulatory clarifications and institutional accumulation signal long-term confidence, caution remains vital amid ongoing volatility—from aggressive trading volumes and derivative products to evolving security concerns. Retail investors are advised to keep a balanced view: monitor key technical levels, remain mindful of regulatory shifts, and consider diversification strategies to navigate an ecosystem marked by both innovation and uncertainty.

SOL has been experiencing a downturn in line with the broader cryptocurrency market, remaining mostly in red over the past 24 hours. However, there's some exciting news coming out of the Solana ecosystem worth keeping an eye on.
Raydium, the leading decentralized exchange on Solana, has launched a new meme coin launchpad designed to rival the popular
  t.co/GNUKI36UbU
In response,
  t.co/GNUKI36UbU
isn't backing down. They've unveiled PumpSwap, a decentralized exchange that directly competes with Raydium. PumpSwap plans to offer fee-free instant token migrations and is looking at revenue-sharing options for creators in the long run. This is particularly impactful for Raydium, considering that previously, tokens needed to surpass a meme-centric market cap of $69,000 to graduate to Raydium, incurring a cost of 6 SOL. With PumpSwap, tokens can now directly list without any associated fees, a change that could shake up the competitive landscape significantly.
The influence of these projects on the Solana ecosystem is undeniable. Recently, Solana has seen its network revenue and DEX volume plummet by 97%, driven largely by the waning excitement around meme coins following recent controversies involving projects like LIBRA and MELANIA.
In an intriguing development for Solana, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, has hinted at the potential creation of a TRX exchange-traded fund (ETF). As of now, there's no official announcement, but this news comes alongside TRX's recent integration into Solana’s ecosystem, enhancing its utility.
Stay tuned for more updates as this dynamic landscape continues to evolve! 🚀

Staking tiers will be determined by the amount of HYPE staked. The initial benefit of staking tiers is reduced trading fees. These updates are expected to go live on or after April 30 to give users time to adjust.
As part of this update, the overall fee system will be reworked. The new fee system will have the following properties:
1. Even without staking discounts, perps and spot fees are lower than CEXs for most users.
2. Fee sensitive users can stake HYPE to benefit from even lower fees than the existing system.
3. Protocol revenue is projected to increase.
4. HYPE will have more utility for users.
What else is changing:
+ Separate fee schedules for perps vs spot
+ Spot volume counts double toward your fee tier
What is not changing:
+ Maker rebates based on % of total maker volume
+ Perps and spot volume combined to determine your fee tier

🚨 Major news from Binance as they have taken decisive action against a market maker linked to GoPlus Security (GPS) and MyShell (SHELL). Following a thorough internal investigation, irregular trading activities were identified, leading to the permanent removal of the market maker from the platform.
The exchange has also confiscated the proceeds of the misconduct, which will be allocated to compensate affected users in future announcements by the respective projects. Binance has reiterated the importance of maintaining strict compliance with market-making guidelines to ensure a stable trading environment.
In a related development, speculation has been rampant regarding the identity of the implicated market maker. High-profile companies like Animoca Brands and GSR have stepped up to clarify their non-involvement in the scandal. Animoca has confirmed they do not engage in market-making for GPS and SHELL, while GSR has emphasized their role as an investor, not a market maker in this context.
This crackdown highlights the integrity measures that Binance is committed to upholding. Traders should remain vigilant and informed about market dynamics as the landscape continues to evolve. 🔍

90% of retail trades in TradFi are controlled by six firms. DeFi was supposed to be different. Instead, we traded one set of middlemen for another.
TradFi’s Problem? No Choice.
Six firms decide where retail orders go. They control execution, widen spreads, and extract value.
DeFi was meant to break that cycle. But what did we get?
DeFi: The Illusion of Choice
Every aggregator and DEX claims to be different. But under the hood, most of them route to the same AMM pools.
No matter where you trade, you’re hitting the same liquidity sources—with the same slippage, the same MEV risk, and the same inefficiencies.
Execution Got Faster—But Liquidity Stayed the Same
DeFi improved execution speed, but liquidity hasn’t evolved. More front-ends, same AMM pools. More routing logic, same fundamental pricing model.
Users get the illusion of choice, but the outcome never really changes.
AMMs: A Good Start, But Not the Answer
They were revolutionary at launch, but now?
- Capital inefficient
- Rigid pricing
- High slippage
- MEV playground
They work—just not well enough for DeFi to scale.
RFQ: The Solution That’s Been Here All Along
RFQ isn’t new. It’s how TradFi’s largest markets operate. And it’s still the best way to get optimal pricing.
Instead of relying on AMM pricing formulas, RFQ lets traders request firm quotes from professional market makers in real time.
Better liquidity. Better execution. Less MEV. Lower fees.
RFQ Fixes What AMMs Can’t
- Guaranteed execution – The price you’re quoted is the price you pay.
- No slippage – No bad fills on large trades.
- No MEV risk – No front-running, sandwiching, or hidden fees.
- Lower costs – RFQ swaps require less gas than AMM swaps.
- Better market maker incentives – No need to lock capital in inefficient pools.
This isn’t theoretical. It’s already working.
RFQ Has Been Winning for Years
Hashflow launched RFQ in 2021. The results speak for themselves:
- $500M+ in market maker liquidity
- $25B+ in RFQ swap volume
- 20+ front-ends powered by Hashflow
Aggregators, wallets, and DEXs are already using it. If your platform still relies on AMMs, you’re lagging.
Better Liquidity Exists—It’s Time to Use It
Wallets, aggregators, DeFi protocols: if you want better pricing and deeper liquidity, Hashflow has it.

Wintermute, a leading cryptocurrency market maker, is set to expand its operations into the United States, tapping into the increasingly crypto-friendly environment in the country. The company plans to open an office in New York and introduce new products for crypto users.
As part of its expansion strategy, Wintermute aims to boost its employee numbers by hiring an additional five to ten staff members, bringing the total team size to around 140. This move comes on the heels of a successful funding round led by Tencent Holdings in July 2024. While the exact amount raised remains undisclosed, it's known that Wintermute was seeking between $100 million and $300 million, which could elevate its valuation to approximately $2 billion.
Wintermute's CEO expressed confidence in the U.S. market, citing potential benefits from the country's regulatory changes. The optimism stems from recent shifts in the political landscape, particularly with a new administration seen as more favorable to digital assets. The past regulatory approach by the SEC had driven some crypto businesses away, but with the return of crypto-friendly policies, companies like Kraken have resumed operations, such as relaunching crypto staking services across 37 states.
The expansion into the U.S. marks a significant step for Wintermute, showcasing its commitment to growth and innovation in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

Short answer: no.
AMMs provide constant liquidity, so the only reason to use a market maker is to generate volume.
The problem is that DEX MMs operate with little transparency unlike CEX MMs, which provide detailed reports on upkeep and depth. With DEX MMs, you have no idea what you're signing up for.
They might promise:
• Increased volume
• Securing runway
• Protection against snipers
But what you could end up with is a heavily manipulated pump and dump.
Not all MMs are evil but the takeaway from the Meteora / Kelsier / $LIBRA episode is to be careful what you sign up for.
Be also skeptical of anyone suggesting you to get a MM.

once considered a music career?
Today, he’s found a way to merge this lifelong passion with the transformative potential of blockchain technology.
In partnership with
@galaxyhq
, we're thrilled to present the mesmerizing sounds of the Empress Caterina—a 1708 violin crafted by history's most celebrated violin maker, Antonio Stradivari. This remarkable instrument, belonging to Yat Siu since 2023, was appraised by Tarisio at ~US$9 million.
Tokenizing this rare violin enables it to be eternalized on the blockchain, allowing users to have the unique opportunity of owning a piece of this rare collectible, participate in its network effect, and potentially have a say in which musician gets a chance to play this timeless instrument in the future.
Just last Friday, a 311-year-old Stradivarius violin sold for US$11.25 million at Sotheby’s, making Empress Caterina the 9th most expensive violin in the world.
