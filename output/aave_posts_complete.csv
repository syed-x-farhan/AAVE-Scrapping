Here’s the answer: every time a big chunk o$CAKE gets unlocked, it increases the circulating supply — and that creates sell pressure.
This chart shows it clearly: as the total locked amount (veCAKE + old pool) goes down, the CAKE/BNB ratio also drops.
Even when $BNB or the market was pumping$CAKE couldn’t follow. Why? Because unlockings increased supply without enough demand to absorb it.

#10
We are connecting the dots that create smarter investors and boost investment success. Each week, we share our efforts and progress towards this goal. We are committed to keeping our community informed on what goes on behind the scenes. As the market continues on the path of recovery, we are honing the tools in our ecosystem and building new ones according to what is required in the dynamic crypto market.
We are diversifying and moving deeper into DeFAI and InfoFi as a tooling mechanism for crypto investors. This week, we made significant progress.
Here’s the 10th edition of our weekly development update
» Attention Index: Following the launch of the Attention Index tab and associated features, we are reviewing the performance in Prod. and deploying fixes where needed. We are also studying user behaviour to ensure that the tool meets the user's requirements. This week, we integrated the ‘overall mentions’ parameter to the tab to present further information on social activity for featured tokens. We also added data on real-time changes in holder count.
» Dexplore: Our blockchain search engine continues to get smarter and faster. The training process continues as we add more information to the model’s library and optimize the performance for faster inferences. We fixed critical bugs and also modified the UI for a better outlook and experience.
» CHECK: This week, we announced CHECK, a progressive reward system for X users contributing to important discussions. Development is already underway for the platform! We hope to share more information on this in subsequent updates.
» Liquidity Boost on Pancakeswap: The $DCK token is native to
@BNBCHAIN
and tradable on
@pancakeSwap
. This week, we added more assets to the tune of $100,000 to the DCK/BUSD pair.
» KOL Tracker and Performance Index: We updated the logic for the KOL tracker and performance index to enable the algorithm to track posts without cash tags. This will significantly improve the accuracy of information generated by both tools.
» New integrations: We completed integrations for
@pumpdotfun
’s new AMM. Users can now track activity on the protocol via DexCheck.
» UI Improvements: We also improved the platform’s design in key areas to adjust to best design practices and improve user experience. You’ll notice major changes in the outlook of the Wallet Analyzer and Token Analytics tools.
» Address Tagging: We are adding labels to unique wallets for identification. This week, we deprecated the old tagging system, tested the new tagging script for Ethereum addresses, and added PnL-based tags for BNB Chain addresses. We also added tags Tron and Ton network addresses.
» Optimizations for existing tools: We are working on major updates for InsightsGPT/ Smart Traders Moves. We are also integrating new changes for Wallet Analyzer across every network supported on the platform.
DexCheck is designed to bring out the best in every trader. With every update and launch, this statement becomes even more realistic. This month, we launched two primary features and several add-ons to existing tools. In the coming week and month, we will continue in this direction and evolve according to users’ and market demand.",2025-04-02 12:34:06

[The Most Published News]
Trump-linked World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has invested $3 million in 3.54 million MNT tokens despite its overall crypto portfolio suffering a loss of about $111 million. In related news, analysts now see upside for XRP following the SEC dropping its longstanding lawsuit against Ripple Labs, forecasting that the token could reach $10 by 2030. Meanwhile, decentralized exchange dYdX’s announcement of a token buyback using 25% of its monthly net revenue has captured significant attention as it signals confidence in reinforcing its ecosystem.
[Current Market Trends]
PancakeSwap led decentralized exchange activity this week with a 41.93% jump in trading volume—totaling $14.1 billion—while Uniswap and Raydium recorded notable declines. Additionally, crypto investment products saw a turnaround after five consecutive weeks of outflows, with inflows amounting to $644 million and spot Bitcoin ETFs reporting robust capital inflows, hinting at a cautiously optimistic sentiment among retail and institutional investors.
[Regulations and Policies]
In a dramatic regulatory development, the SEC’s decision to drop its lawsuit against Ripple Labs has clarified the outlook for XRP and broader crypto initiatives. Complementing this, a U.S. Senator has proposed a bold plan to eliminate the Federal Reserve, while the Trump administration moves forward with plans to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Further stirring the debate, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer criticized the U.S. Treasury’s handling of the Tornado Cash lawsuit, spotlighting ongoing challenges in the regulatory landscape.
[Technology and Innovation]
Dubai-based DWF Labs has launched a $250 million fund aimed at mid- to large-cap blockchain projects, with an emphasis on overcoming onboarding hurdles and strengthening infrastructure for mainstream crypto adoption. In another innovation push, Ethereum is set to roll out two major upgrades, Pectra and Fusaka, expected to enhance staking efficiency, scalability, and smart contract functionality. Meanwhile, Circle is gearing up to launch its USDC stablecoin in Japan through a partnership with SBI Holdings, marking the first regulated stablecoin introduction in the country.
[Institutional Investor News]
Institutional confidence in crypto is underscored by significant moves in Bitcoin accumulation. Michael Saylor’s Strategy recently acquired 6,911 BTC—boosting its total holdings to over 506,000 BTC—while MicroStrategy made a sizeable $584 million Bitcoin purchase to further expand its digital asset portfolio. BlackRock has also deepened its crypto reach by expanding its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to the Solana blockchain, reflecting the growing appetite among institutional investors for yield-generating, blockchain-based products.
[Market Forecasts and Expert Opinions]
Market analysts remain bullish on long-term ratings despite short-term volatility. With the SEC lawsuit behind it, XRP is projected to hit $10 by 2030, a forecast supported by potential uplifts from the adoption of Ripple’s own stablecoin and prospects for an IPO. In addition, QCP Capital highlights historical trends showing that April and Q2 typically favor both risk assets and Bitcoin, suggesting that the current market environment could see renewed positive momentum if macro factors stabilize.
[Security and Hacking News]
Security challenges persist in the crypto space. Dohrnii Labs has filed a police report in the UAE against Blynex, accusing the exchange of unauthorized liquidation of its DHN tokens amid a broader backdrop of market turbulence. In a related development, Movement Network has announced it will use recovered funds—amounting to $38 million from a rogue market maker misconduct case—to execute a token buyback program aimed at restoring market stability and investor confidence.
[Conclusion]
Today’s broad array of crypto news underlines a market in transition. While regulatory clarifications and institutional accumulation signal long-term confidence, caution remains vital amid ongoing volatility—from aggressive trading volumes and derivative products to evolving security concerns. Retail investors are advised to keep a balanced view: monitor key technical levels, remain mindful of regulatory shifts, and consider diversification strategies to navigate an ecosystem marked by both innovation and uncertainty.

Right now $CAKE is looking pretty solid!

While I can't rule out a potential test of the 0.5 imbalance around $2.17 if we can hold our ground up here I see a breakout towards the $3.40 mark as quite likely.

's dog '$BROCCOLI'?
The meme culture was also inspired from Changpeng Zhao's (CZ) post about his dog, Broccoli, which led to the creation of several meme coins named after the dog.
One of these meme coins, saw its market cap soar to over $200 million.
The surge in meme coin trading volume drove PancakeSwap, BNB Chain’s decentralized exchange, to outperform all decentralized exchanges in trading volume, reaching over $15.9 billion on Feb. 13.

's bullposting skill
Changpeng Zhao’s CZ’s frequent updates, strategic bullposting, and engagement with the community can be thanked for piloting investors choice to the black 'n' yellow chain.
There's so much to be excited about on the BNB ecosystem.
